The solution was sonicated for about 20 minutes in order to exfoliate the GO sheets that are initially stacked in the dispersion . To this, 50 μL of diluted hydrochloric acid ( HCl , 1 M ) were added dropwise and mixed with the solution . The addition of HCl is needed for the later stabilization of the macroemulsion . Thereafter, a toluene solution containing the Cu2-xS NCs ( 200 μL ) was added to the diluted GO solution . Upon addition of the toluene solution an emulsion was formed in the vial by manual shaking . Subsequently, the emulsion was sonicated in order to decrease droplet size, leading to the formation of a macroemulsion having a milky appearance . Pure toluene/GO macroemulsions ( in the absence of Cu2-xS NCs ) were prepared in an analogous way, but using pure toluene instead of Cu2-xS NCs in toluene . The reference Cu2-xS NCs samples were prepared by diluting the original NC's solution two times , in order to obtain similar NC's concentration . The synthesis of 5 nm Cu2-xS NCs was performed according to a previous report . 8 Typically, the synthesis was performed by mixing 1.25 mmol of ammonium diethyldithiocarbamate , 10 mL of dodecanethiol and 17 mL of oleic acid in a three-neck flask .

The water used in all experiments was prepared in a three-stage Millipore Milli-Q Plus 185 purification system and had a resistivity higher than 18.2 MΩ cm . Sulfur particles were separately dispersed in PEI solution ( 1 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl ) and allowed to adsorb for 30 min . Then excess polyelectrolytes were removed by centrifugation and three times washing with 0.5 M NaCl . Subsequently the above suspensions were alternately dispersed in PAH and PSS solution ( 2 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl ) for another 30 min , followed by three times washing in 0.5 M NaCl . After the assembly of a desired number of PAH/PSS layer , the coated particles were then dispersed in 5 % glutaraldehyde ( GA ) aqueous solution for 30 min . Finally these sample suspensions were incubated at the high temperature for 20 min . In a typical procedure, the prepared polymer-coated sulfur particles aqueous dispersion was added into the aniline monomer solution mixed with 1 M hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) under stirring . After 30 min , the equivalent number of moles of 22.8 wt% aqueous ammonium persulphate ( APS ) solution ( with respect to aniline ) was slowly added , followed by an oxidative polymerization at 0-3 degC . The reaction was carried out for 24 h . The resultant green solid , PANI/polymer-coated sulfur particles , were obtained by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol thoroughly to remove excess ions and monomers . The procedure was repeated to increase the PANI content . The final product was dried under vacuum at ambient temperature for 24 h .

Ltd . ( Tokyo, Japan ) . It was reported to have epoxy cure site and was made from ethyl acrylate monomer . Tetraethoxysilane ( TEOS , density 930 kg/m3 ) was procured from Acros Organics ( USA ) . Tetrahydrofuran ( THF , 99 % pure ) was purchased from Merck ( India ) . The precipitated silica ( Ultrasil VN3 , particle size range 40-100 nm , oil absorption 2.4 g/kg , pH 6 ) was supplied by Bayer AG ( Germany ) . Benzoyl peroxide ( BPO , 97 % purity ) was purchased from Aldrich Chemicals ( USA ) . Hexamethylenediamine carbamate ( HMDC , DIAK 1 ) was supplied by Nicco Corp . Ltd . ( India ) . Ammonium benzoate ( AmBz ) was prepared in the laboratory by reacting ammonium hydroxide and benzoic acid in 1:1 molar ratio in a water bath at around 60 degC for 30 min . The salt formation was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as well as by studying its solubility . Deionized water and concentrated hydrochloric acid of laboratory grade were obtained from indigenous sources . The desired amount of ACM was dissolved in THF solvent . A proportion of the rubber to solvent was maintained at about 1 : 10 all throughout the experiment to retain the uniform viscosity of the reaction medium . TEOS , deionized water , and concentrated HCl as catalyst , in the molar ratio of 1 : 2 : 0.06 , 15 were throughly mixed by vigorous stirring for 15 min and then the mixture was added to the rubber solution under stirring conditions at ambient temperature . The proportion of TEOS was from 0 to 50 wt % of the ACM . Beyond 50 wt % TEOS , macrophase separation occurred . The formulations used in this study are given in Table I . The precursor solution for preparing the composites was stirred for 30 min and then poured over a uniform and thoroughly cleaned glass plate . The initial evaporation of the solvent was carried out under controlled conditions for 24 h , and then, in the next phase, further evaporation for 4 days was allowed to remove the residual solvent and byproducts ( water and ethanol ) . The optimum gelling time was taken when practically no weight variation of the hybrid composites was noticed . All the films were transparent in appearance . For comparison, composites were also prepared with precipitated silica up to 30 wt % of its loading ( beyond which the resultant film lost its homogeneity ) . The precipitated silica was initially dried at 120 degC for 24 h and then dispersed in the ACM solution . All the composite films with precipitated silica were opaque and completely white in color . To crosslink the rubber phase, curatives were added to the solvated rubber . The two different curatives systems used in this study were BPO and a mixed crosslinked system comprising AmBz and HMDC , following an earlier work on acrylic rubber in our laboratory . 16 Optimization of the doses of different curatives ( Table I ) was carried out by studying the maximum gel content in THF . Addition of curatives was made only after complete mixing of TEOS , water , and HCl with solvated ACM for 30 min . The crosslinkers were dispersed under ambient conditions and then stirred for another 30 min for homogenous mixing . The films were cast over a plain glass plate as before and kept for controlled solvent evaporation for 24 h . In the next phase, peroxide-containing composite films were kept in the oven at 70 degC for 2 h for curing , whereas the samples having mixed crosslinked system were cured at 170 degC for 30 min . The above cure times were optimized",

A multilamellar MFI was synthesized using the method reported by Ryoo and co-workers,43 through a coherent assembly of the zeolite layer and the structure directing agent , a diquaternary ammonium surfactant with a relatively long hydrocarbon chain . Pillaring of multilamellar MFI was done as reported by Na et al.42 to produce PMFI , using a similar pillaring procedure to that of swollen MWW ( P ) .

Then the mixture was immediately covered and placed into an ultrasonic bath ( 200 W and 42 kHz ) for simultaneous oxidization and ultrasonication ( oxidi-sonication ) . A cooler was connected with the bath to prevent heat build-up . During the oxidi-sonication , graphite flakes could exfoliate and split into graphene sheets ; meanwhile, they were oxidized by Mn2O7 that was created by 2KMnO4 (s) + H2SO4 (aq) - Mn2O7 (l) + K2SO4 + H2O . The reaction can be terminated anytime by moving the mixture out of the bath and then adding 120 g water slowly , followed by vacuum filtrating and washing three times with water and hydrogen peroxide for removal of ions and acids . The prepared sheets should be stored in solvents such as water or acetone for the following film fabrication . For characterization in need of powder samples , the sheets were dried in an air-ventilated oven at 60 degC and then in a vacuum oven at 100 degC for 4 hours to remove crystalline water . Although we started with 0.1 g graphite , the product was weighed to be 0.105 g ; the slight increment would be caused by the O element added by the oxidi-sonication and also likely due to the combined water",

This material was placed in a glass reaction vessel with 300 mg of tungsten carbonyl precursor ( Sigma , St . Louis, MO ) . The reaction vessel was evacuated to 100 m Torr to remove air from the reaction chamber as well as to remove volatiles from the polymer matrix . While under vacuum , the entire system was placed in a furnace and heated to 150 degC to vaporize the precursor . The vessel was held at temperature for at least 3 hs to allow precursor diffusion into the polymer . Subsequent heating to 175 degC produced thermal decomposition of the precursor within the polymer and this temperature was held for approximately 4 h to permit particle formation and growth . The system was allowed to cool gradually to room temperature . This process resulted in a polymer film reinforced with discrete , tungsten-oxide nanoparticles distributed throughout the bulk of the material . Since the matrix is not degraded during particle synthesis, the process described can be performed repeatedly to coarsen existing particles and to nucleate new ones . For the work reported here, PMNCs are designated according to the number of processing cycles a given material experienced - 1x for one processing cycle , 2x for two cycles , etc . There are physical limits to the number of processing cycles that a material can undergo related to the precursor diffusion into the material, however the practical working limit relates primarily to the time required for synthesis .

        "input": "10 . 1016 / j . conbuildmat . 2014 . 05 . 031 Characterization of mechanical and microstructural properties of palm oil fuel ash geopolymer cement paste The palm oil fuel ash ( POFA ) , obtained from burning of palm oil shells , husk and fibers , was collected from a mill at Johor State , south of Malaysia . The raw palm oil fuel ash was oven dried at 110 +- 5 degC for 24 h , sieved with a 300 μm sieve to remove large unwanted particles and incompletely combusted materials [49] and [50] , and then it was ground by a modified Los Angeles machine [42] . The specific surface area after grinding was 0.915 m2/g . The chemical composition of the POFA by XRF test is shown in Table 1 . As can be seen, major components are SiO2 and CaO with concentrations of 47.37 % and 11.83 % , respectively with a low amount of Al2O3 ( 3.53 % ) . The relatively high amount of CaO available in the POFA is most likely from lime and fertilizer [41] . It is worth to mention that POFA is a not toxic waste material in terms of heavy metals leachability [51] . Sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate were chosen as alkali activators in this investigation . The sodium hydroxide was in industrial-grade with minimum 99 % purity . Industrial grade water glass ( Na2SiO3 ) solution was chosen with a chemical composition of 15.33 % Na2O , 31.28 % SiO2 , and 53 % H2O . The alkaline activator selection was based on the recommendations in [34] , [53] , [54] and [55] . The alkali activation solution was prepared by mixing Na2SiO3 with NaOH within ratios ranged between 0.5 and 3.0 [34] . Preliminary experiments were conducted to study the alkali activation of POFA [56] . It revealed that raw POFA cannot be used without sieving and grinding because of the low compressive strength results which is related to the porous structure and high demands for the alkaline activator . Experimental program was designed in order to investigate the ability of POFA to be incorporated in geopolymer technology . NaOH solution was mixed with Na2SiO3 to produce six ratios ( 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , and 3 ) to prepare alkaline activator solution 24 h prior to use . Ground POFA and the alkaline activator were then mixed with two solid-to-liquid ratios ( 1.0 , 1.32 ) as in [34] , [53] , [57] and [58] . Two groups of twelve mixes were prepared based on the solid to liquid ratio as shown in Table 2 . Mix one with sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide ratio ( 0.5 ) was unable to be used ; the geopolymer paste had such low workability that could not be cast in molds . The palm oil fuel ash was mixed directly with the alkaline activator . First the ash was discharged to the mixer pan , and then the alkaline was added and mixed for 1.0 min at a normal speed rate ( gear one ) . Then, the mixer stopped for 10-20 s in order to scrap the un-mixed ash on the sides of the paddle and the pan , then the mixing was continued with a medium speed ( gear two ) for another 1.0 min in accordance to ASTM C305 [59] . All the geopolymer paste mixes were blended and produced with a small blender ( HOBART Mixer ) . The fresh geopolymer paste was then cast into 50 x 50 x 50 mm iron molds in two layers immediately after mixing . To compact the specimen , each layer was vibrated by a vibrating table for 25-30 s . This procedure was used to remove the bubbles from the paste . After casting and vibrating , oven curing was applied directly at 60 degC for 2 h . The molds were then kept in the laboratory to reach ambient temperature . The specimens were kept in a plastic bags after de-molding to prevent any moisture loss and were stored to the date of testing [55]",

Deionized water ( 18 MΩ cm ) was used for all the preparations after deoxygenation . Synthesis of the Co NPs Citrate-stabilized Co NPs were prepared from classical NaBH4 reduction . 56 In a typical synthesis, cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate ( 115.5 mg , 0.397 mmol ) and citric acid monohydrate ( 83-167 mg , 0.397-0.793 mmol , 1-2 equiv . ) were added to deoxygenated water ( 175 mL ) under mechanical stirring . After 1 h under nitrogen stripping , NaBH4 ( 150 mg , 3.97 mmol , 10 equiv . ) previously solubilized in cold water ( 5 mL ) was quickly added to the vigorously stirred solution . The mixture turned black , which is indicative of reduced cobalt NP formation . In certain cases, PVP ( 600 mg ) was added immediately after the introduction of NaBH4 to form PVP-stabilized Co NPs . Complete dissolution of the polymer occurred rapidly ( < 1 min ) . Encapsulation of the Co NPs in Silica , Co@SiO2 Co@SiO2 were prepared by controlled growth of the silica shell on the Co NPs in an ethanol / water mixture according to a modified Stober method.16 After the in situ synthesis of the Co NPs , an ethanol solution ( 390-780 mL ) containing APTES ( 77 μL , 0.331 mmol , 0.8 equiv . ) and TEOS ( 881 μL , 3.97 mmol , 10 equiv . ) was added to the NP solution . This one-pot reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 h before centrifuging and drying to isolate the silica-coated particles . Synthesis of Cobalt-Mesoporous Silica NPs ( Co@m-SiO2 ) Co@SiO2 were used as a silica source for the synthesis of Co@m-SiO2 by a PMT . 40 The appropriate quantity of Co@SiO2 was dispersed into an alkaline solution containing CTAB . The molar composition of the system was 1:0.11:0.24:395:36 SiO2 / CTAB / NaOH / H2O / EtOH . After 1 h of stirring at room temperature , the gel was put in an autoclave and heated at 100 degC for 24 h under static conditions . The final solid was recovered by centrifugation , washed with water , and dried at 80 degC for 12 h . The CTAB rod-like template was removed by thermal treatment under hydrogen in a programmed heated tubular oven before use . The temperature was initially increased from room temperature to 400 degC at a rate of 5 degC min-1 , and the temperature kept for 4 h to remove the organic phase . Synthesis of Co/SiO2 The cobalt-based reference catalyst Co/SiO2 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation over a silica-based carrier ( SBET 241 m2 g-1 , Vp 0.41 mL g-1 , and Dp 5.7 nm ) starting from an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate . Subsequently, the impregnated catalyst was dried by direct heating of the sample from room temperature to 85 degC for one night . Finally, the catalyst was calcined at 420 degC in dry air for 4 h and activated by a reduction treatment under pure hydrogen .

The stoichiometric values of lithium , nickel and cobalt nitrate salts in a cationic ratio of Li Ni Co equal to 1:0.8:0.2 were dissolved in distilled water . Three chelating agents including triethanolamine ( TEA ) , citric acid , oxalic acid are used in this investigation . These agents were used in a molar ratio of 1 with respect to the total metal cations by dissolving in distilled water . The solution was then added to the nitrate solution and was heated under constant stirring at 80 degC for 1 h . The resulting sol was heated at 100 degC to form the gel which was dried subsequently . To remove the moisture and achieve the dried mass, the obtained gel was successively dried at 100 , 120 , 150 , 200 degC for 2 h per each step and 5 h at 240 degC . The thermal behavior of LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 powders was determined by thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) conducted on the dried gel at a heating rate of 5 degC min-1 up to 1100 degC in the air using a Perkin Elmer analyzer .

Then, dried GO ( 10 mg ) was suspended in the solution with vigorous stirring , and a homogeneous dispersion of GO in this solution was promoted by sonication using a 400 W probe sonicator ( Branson Digital Sonifier 450 ) with 10 % amplitude for 10 min ( 24 kJ ) in an ice bath . It is noteworthy to point out that, although THF is not a good solvent for GOs , amine terminated telechelic PDMS can effectively act as a surfactant to assist in dispersing GOs homogeneously in THF through hydrogen bonding between amine ends and oxygen containing groups on GO surfaces . A good dispersion after sonication was confirmed by examining the residual liquid film in the vial while rolling the vial containing the solution and after pouring the majority of the solution into a PTFE dish for solution casting . In either case, the liquid film in the vial was essentially transparent ( although brownish-black from the GO content ) for all solution concentrations and no aggregates could be identified with the naked eye .

Ba ( 9.5 mmol ) and La ( 0.5 mmol ) acetates and Fe nitrate ( 10 mmol ) were first dissolved in water ( 100 mL ) . The mixed metal salt solution was then added to ethanol ( 100 mL ) containing oxalic acid ( 90 mmol ) . The mixing produced a yellow-colored suspension , which was allowed to stand for 1 h . The use of ethanol was critical to the precipitation of the metal oxalates . The suspension was filtrated to collect the precursor metal oxalate particles . The obtained precursor powder was dried at 120 degC for 2 h and then calcined at 700 degC for 2 h . The calcined powder was press-formed into a disk to form a green porous support disk . A BLF powder as the precursor of a dense layer was prepared by an AMP method 31 . An aqueous malic acid solution ( 50 mL ) was added to a solution ( 50 mL ) containing the corresponding metal nitrates or acetates in a stoichiometric ratio under vigorous stirring . The molar ratio of malic acid to total metal ions was set to 1.5 . The pH of the mixed aqueous solution was adjusted to 6 with aqueous ammonia ( 28 % ) . The mixed solution was evaporated to dryness and the obtained powder was calcined in air at 800 degC . The calcined powder was ground and dispersed in ethanol to prepare a precursor slurry ( 10 wt % ) for fabricating a dense layer on a porous support . A dense BLF layer was formed by dropping the slurry ( 0.6 mL ) on the green porous support . The support disk was dried at room temperature and sintered at 1175 degC for 5 h to fabricate an asymmetric BLF membrane . For comparison, sintered-disk-type BLF membranes were also fabricated using the BLF powder prepared by the AMP method . The thickness of the sintered-disk membranes was controlled to about 1.0 and 0.5 mm by polishing the surfaces with emery paper ( # 80 ) . The morphology of the surface and cross-sections of the asymmetric membrane were observed with a SEM ( JSM-6340F, JEOL Co., LTD. ) . The oxygen permeation flux through the fabricated asymmetric membrane was measured using the apparatus used in the previous study 18 . The dense layer side of the asymmetric membrane was fixed on a quartz tube using a silver ring as an adhesive agent at 960-970 degC . Air ( O2 / N2 mixture gases ) and He were supplied to the porous support side and dense layer side, respectively . The flow rates of air ( O2 / N2 mixture gases ) and He were 200 and 150 mL min-1 , respectively . The concentration of permeated oxygen from the air side to the He side was detected with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) of a gas chromatograph",

The stoichiometric amount of starting materials , such as cobaltous acetate and ferric chloride were taken in 1:1 , 1:2 , 1:3 and 1:4 M ratios , respectively, and dissolved into required amount of distilled water to form 1 M solution . First of all, we have taken cobaltous acetate and ferric chloride in 1:1 M ratios and dissolved into respective required amount of distilled water to form precursors . The above precursors were refluxed at 60 degC for 4 h to get homogeneous solution . After that both were mixed with each other . The obtained mixed solution was heated at 70-80 degC and magnetically stirred for 4 h . 10 ml of poly-ethylene glycol ( PEG ) was added to the mixed solution which acts as an encapsulating agent . The resulting solution was precipitated by ammonium hydroxide solution , which was added drop by drop to the above mixed solution and a black colored precipitate was obtained . The pH of the solution was constantly monitored as the NH4OH solution was added until it reached to 12 . Then the mixture was mechanically stirred at room temperature for 6 h and the precipitate was washed several times with distilled water until the pH of the filtrate became 7 . This whole procedure was repeated for synthesis of CoFe2O4 in 1:2 , 1:3 as well as 1:4 M ratios , respectively . Here, ammonium hydroxide was used for smooth liberation of the hydroxide ions in place of strong alkali ( potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide ) . Strong alkaline solutions are prone to result in the conversion of Fe3+ and Co2+ into CoFe2O4 immediately, usually leading to the formation of severely agglomerated nanoparticles with irregular shapes . Similar procedure was used for the synthesis of nanostructured ferric oxide . Initially in aqueous solution , metal ions exist as Co ( H 2 O ) 6 2 + and Fe ( H 2 O ) 6 3 + . As pH was increased , the predominant species existing in solution became Co ( OH ) 6 2 - x and Fe ( OH ) y 3 - y , respectively . At the solubility minima, the predominant species in solution were Co(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3 . Further, when the concentration of ammonia solution was increased , cobalt and iron became more soluble as Co ( OH ) 3 - and Fe ( OH ) 4 - species . The synthesis temperature was maintained at 70-80 degC for 4-5 h under vigorous magnetic stirring . The precipitate of CoFe2O4 was obtained through centrifugal settling for 15 min at 3000 rpm . The precipitate was dried overnight at 100 degC . The dried material was grinded into fine powder . The fine powder was then annealed at 450 degC inside a tubular furnace for 2 h with heating and cooling rate of 2 degC per minute . Sensing pellets of the synthesized powder were made by hydraulic press ( MB instruments, Delhi ) under a uniaxial pressure of 616 MPa .
