For the solution synthesis of Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12using EDA (98.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and EDT (98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), ET (99%, Alfa-Aesar) Li2S (99.9%, Alfa-Aesar), P2S5(99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), LiCl (99.99%, Alfa-Aesar), GeS2(99.9%, American Elements), Na2S (Sigma-Aldrich), and SnS2(99%, MKN) were used as precursor materials. Stoichiometric mixtures were added to the EDA–EDT mixture solvent and stirred at 60 °C for 3 h. For EDT- and ET-Na11Sn2PS12, the solution was stirred at 70 °C. All synthetic procedures were performed under an argon atmosphere. Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5and Na3PS4used for separating SE layers in all-solid-state Li- and Na-ion cells, respectively, was prepared via ball milling and subsequent HT under an Ar atmosphere. For Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5, after a stoichiometric mixture of Li2S, P2S5, LiCl, and LiBr was ball-milled at 600 rpm for 10 h in a ZrO2vial with ZrO2balls using a Pulverisette 7PL (Fritsch GmbH), it was subjected to HT at 550 °C for 5 h under an Ar atmosphere. For Na3PS4, a stoichiometric mixture of Na2S and P2S5was ball-milled at 500 rpm for 1 h in a ZrO2vial with ZrO2balls using a Pulverisette 7PL, followed by HT at 270 °C for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere. Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5and Na3PS4exhibited ionic conductivities of 4.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 9.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C, respectively. To prepare the Na2S–NSPS–C nanocomposites, stoichiometric amounts of Na2S, SnS2, and P2S5powders were fully dissolved in the EDA–EDT solvent and stirred at 70 °C for 3 h. Super C65 was then added, and the solution was stirred. The target weight ratio of Na2S/Na11Sn2PS12/super C65 was 30:50:20. The solvent was removed at 150 °C for 3 h under vacuum, and the as-obtained powders were subjected to HT at 700 °C for 12 h under an argon atmosphere. The mixture electrodes were prepared via conventional manual mixing of Na2S, NSPS (prepared by solid-state synthesis, 0.8 mS cm−1), and super C65, with a weight ratio of 30:50:20.
