Commercial 5,7,12,14-pentacenetetrone was obtained from TCI and used as received for active materials. The solid electrolytes Li7P3S11(LPS) glass ceramic used in this work was synthesized via a solid-state route as reported elsewhere. Typically, sulfide (Li2S, 99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5, 99%, Aladdin) with molar ratio of 70:30 were weighted and ground together. 2 g of powder was loaded into a ZrO2ball-mill jar with 40 g of 5 mm diameter ZrO2balls. The jars were placed in Planetary Micro Mill (Pulverisette 7, Fritsch) and milled for 30 h at 400 rpm (10 min of milling followed by 5 min breaks to dissipate heat). The resulting powder was subsequently annealed at 210 °C for 3 h and 250 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 and cooled to room temperature naturally. All the above experiments were carried out under Ar atmosphere.
