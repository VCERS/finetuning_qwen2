Li6PS5I glass-ceramic was synthesized via UEMA method. The starting materials were Li2S (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), P2S5(99.9%, Alfa Aesar), and LiI (99.99%, Aladdin). 2 g overall mass of Li2S, P2S5,and LiI with molar ratio of 5: 1: 2 were weighed and put into a zirconia jar (125mL) with 25 zirconia balls (10 mm in diameter, overall mass = 75 g). The mechanosynthesized process was carried out on the mechanical alloying apparatus (Retsch, Emax) with 1200 rpm for different alloying time. In order to avoid high-temperature decomposition of samples due to high-speed grinding, the milling apparatus was equipped with a cooling machine to maintain the temperature of the zirconia jar at 298–308 K. In particular, when the mechanical alloying timet= 0 min, the raw materials were mixed uniformly in a mortar for 20 min. The traditional Li6PS5I crystal was synthesized via milling at 600 rpm for 13 h. The obtained precursors were pressed into pellets, and then sealed in a quartz ampule and annealed at 873 K for 2 h. For ensuring the adequate reaction of the raw materials, the Li6PS5Br, Li6PS5Cl, and Li6.5In0.25P0.75S5I electrolytes were prepared via mechanical alloying at 1200 rpm for 60 min. The cathode in solid-state batteries consisted of sublimed sulfur, vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF), and SSE. The S, VGCF, and SSE were mixed at the mass ratio of 7: 1: 2 by grinding at 300 rpm for 1 h. All of the preparation processes were operated in an argon-filled glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2< 0.1 ppm).
