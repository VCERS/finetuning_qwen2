Stoichiometric raw materials (Li2S, P2S5, LiI, and SnS2) were weighed (total 1 g) and sealed in zirconia ball milling pots. The mass ratio between the mixture and the zirconia ball was 1:40. Low-speed ball milling (180 rpm for 2 h) was used at first to fully mix the starting materials. After that, high-speed of 510 rpm for 13 h was conducted on the mixture. All ball milling processes were protected under Ar gas atmosphere by using planetary ball milling apparatus. Then, the ball-milled product was pressed into pellets, and sealed in quartz tubes for postannealing treatment. The annealing condition was 450 °C/8 h in the muffle furnace. The rate of increasing temperature was fixed at 5 °C min−1. After the annealing was completed, the sample naturally cooled down to RT. It was noted that S vacancy can be produced by partly replacing P2S5with SnS2in the starting raw materials, which can be represented by the following defect equation using Kröger–Vink notation: . Through reacting with other reactants, the S vacancy was occupied, while more Li atoms were introduced to keep the charge balance, increasing the solubility of Li+ ions in the crystal structure.
