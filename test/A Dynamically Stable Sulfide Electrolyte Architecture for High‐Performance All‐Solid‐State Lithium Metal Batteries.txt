Single-crystalline NCM811 sample without coating or doping modifications was purchased from Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co. Ltd. Lithium metal anode (200 µm thick) was bought from China Energy Lithium Co. Ltd. LPSCl, Li7P3S11,and 0.7Li3PS4-0.3LiI electrolyte powders were supplied by Ganfeng Lithium Group Co. Ltd. LGePS powder was supported by Guilin Electrical Equipment Scientific Research Institute Co. Ltd. LSnPS electrolyte was synthesized by mechanical ball milling and annealing. Li2S (99.98%, Sigma Aldrich), SnS2(99.5%, Energy Chemical), and P2S5(99.9%, Alfa Aesar) were weighed and put into a zirconia jar (125 mL) together with 25 zirconia balls. Mechanical milling was performed with a milling machine (Fritsch, P7) for 2 hours at a speed of 580 rpm min−1. The mixed powder was pressed into pellets and then sintered for 2 h at 873 K. The sintered pellets were ultimately powdered in a mortar. The LSnS electrolyte was produced via a gas-phase synthesis route. The stoichiometric Li2CO3(99.99%, Innochem) and SnO2(99.9%, Macklin) were hand-ground and transferred into an alumina crucible in a tubular furnace. N2with a controlled flow rate was passed through CS2liquid, thereby converting CS2into gaseous reaction gas into a tubular furnace. The reactant was heated at 500 °C for 24 h, and the product was ground to obtain solid electrolyte powder.
