{"example": "<|im_start|>assistant\nThe original text of the first example is:\n\nIn one aspect of the present invention, provided is a solid electrolyte for an all-solid battery that may include sulfur (S) element derived from an elemental sulfur powder, a phosphorus (P) element derived from an elemental phosphorus powder, a lithium (Li) element derived from an elemental lithium powder, and a halogen element derived from a halogen compound powder. Preferably, the solid electrolyte may have an argyrodite-type crystal structure.\n\nThe term \"all-solid cell\" or \"all-solid battery\" as used herein refers to a cell or a battery that includes only solid or substantially solid-state components, such as solid state electrodes (e.g. anode and cathode) and solid electrolyte. Thus, in preferred aspect, an all-solid cell will not include a fluid and/or flowable electrolyte component as a material or component.\n\nThe term \"argyrodite crystal\", \"argyrodite crystal system\" or \"argyrodite-type crystal\" as used herein refers to a crystal structure having a crystal structure or system similar to naturally existing Ag8GeS6 (Argyrodite). The argyrodite crystal may be orthorhombic having Pna21 space group and having a unit cell of a=15.149, b=7.476, c=10.589 [\u00c5]; Z=4. The argyrodite crystal also may empirically be determined for example, by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy by observing peaks around at 2\u03b8=15.5\u00b11\u00b0, 18\u00b11\u00b0, 26\u00b11\u00b0, 30.5\u00b11\u00b0, and 32\u00b11\u00b0.\n\nThe halogen element of the solid electrolyte discussed above may include bromine (Br), chlorine (Cl), iodine (I) or combinations thereof.\n\nThe solid electrolyte may suitably have an argyrodite-type crystal structure, as represented by Chemical Formula 1:\nLi6PS5X\u2003\u2003[Chemical Formula 1]\nwherein X is Cl, Br or I.\n\nFor example, the solid electrolyte may suitably have an argyrodite-type crystal structure, as represented by Chemical Formula 2:\nLi6PS5Cl\u2003\u2003[Chemical Formula 2]", "output": "none"}
