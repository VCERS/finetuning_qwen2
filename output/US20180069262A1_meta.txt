{"example": "<|im_start|>assistant\nThe original text of the first example in the given patent description is as follows:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, a sulfide solid electrolyte was produced by the following steps:\n\n1. Mixing of Raw Materials: Lithium sulfide (Li2S), phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5), lithium chloride (LiCl), and elemental sulfur (S) were mixed in a glove box under an argon atmosphere. The molar ratio of Li2S:P2S5:LiCl:S was 42.2:11.1:35.6:11.1.\n\n2. Mechanical Milling: The mixed raw materials were placed in a zirconia pot (45 mL) equipped with a planetary ball mill. Zirconia balls (10 mm in diameter) were added to the pot, and the mixture was subjected to mechanical milling at 370 rpm for 25 hours. This process resulted in an intermediate containing glass components.\n\n3. Heat Treatment: The intermediate was heat-treated in a nitrogen atmosphere at 520\u00b0C for 8 hours to obtain a sulfide solid electrolyte.\n\nThe resulting sulfide solid electrolyte had an ionic conductivity of 8.9 mS/cm and was confirmed to contain an argyrodite type crystal structure by X-ray diffraction analysis.", "output": "none"}
