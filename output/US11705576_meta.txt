{"example": "<|im_start|>assistant\nThe first example in the given text describes the production of a sulfide-based solid electrolyte using a method involving the reaction of lithium sulfide (Li2S) and phosphorus sulfide (P2S5) in the presence of chlorobenzene as the solvent. The specific amounts used in the example are:\n\n- 0.661 g of lithium sulfide (Li2S)\n- 0.914 g of phosphorus sulfide (P2S5)\n- 0.164 g of bromine (Br2)\n- 0.261 g of iodine (I2)\n\nThe reaction mixture is placed in a zirconia container of a planetary ball mill, along with 4 g of dehydrated chlorobenzene as the solvent. The container is then sealed and placed in the ball mill for simultaneous mixing, stirring, and grinding at a rotation speed of 500 rpm for 40 hours. After the reaction, the resulting slurry is filtered, dried, and heated at 188\u00b0C for 3 hours to obtain a crystalline sulfide-based solid electrolyte. The ion conductivity of the crystalline electrolyte is measured to be 5.74\u00d710^-3 S/cm, indicating its high ion conductivity.", "output": "none"}
