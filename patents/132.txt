The original text of the first example is:

In some embodiments, the compound is not layered VS2, spinel Co3O4, layered V2O5, rocksalt MnO, spinel Mn2O4, spinel Mn3O4, or layered ZrS2. In some embodiments, the compound is not layered VS2, spinel Co3O4, layered V2O5, rocksalt MnO, spinel Mn2O4, spinel Mn3O4, or layered ZrS2.

This text describes a set of compounds that are not suitable for use as electrode materials in magnesium batteries. Specifically, it excludes layered VS2, spinel Co3O4, layered V2O5, rocksalt MnO, spinel Mn2O4, spinel Mn3O4, and layered ZrS2 compounds.
