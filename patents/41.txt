The original text of the first example is as follows:

(Example 1)

Lithium sulfide (Li2S), phosphorus sulfide (P2S5), silicon sulfide (SiS2) and lithium bromide as lithium halide (LiBr) were weighed and mixed so as to have the composition formula shown in Table 1, A zirconium ball having a mass of 20 times the total mass of the raw material and a raw material were placed in an alumina vessel having a capacity of 100 mL and pulverized for 12 hours with a table-top type ball mill "V-1M" manufactured by Iri Sho Kaisha to prepare a mixed powder. This mixed powder was filled in a vessel made of carbon and heated at a temperature rise and fall rate of 300 °C/h while flowing hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S, purity of 100%) at 1.0 L/min in a tubular electric furnace, Fired for 4 hours, and then cooled down. Thereafter, the sample was pulverized with a mortar and sieved with a sieve having an opening of 53 μm to obtain a powdery sample.

At this time, the above weighing, mixing, set in an electric furnace, taking out from an electric furnace, and crushing and sizing work were all carried out in a glove box substituted with sufficiently dried Ar gas (dew point -60 °C or lower).

The obtained sample was analyzed as described below. As a result, it was found that a crystalline solid which can be represented by the composition formula: Li x Si y P z S u Ha w (where Ha is Br. (Xy) / (y + z) = 3.00) Electrolyte, and the content of Si was 6.2 mass% and the content of Br was 0.04 mass%.

The obtained samples were subjected to X-ray diffraction analysis as described below. As a result, peaks were observed at the positions of 2θ = 20.2 °, 24.0 °, 25.2 °, 27.0 °, 29.1 ° and 29.7 °. Of these, only the peak values in the respective ranges of 20.2 0.5, 24.0 0.5, 29.7 0.5 and 24.8 0.5 (26.1 0.5) are shown in Table 3 (the same also applies to the following examples).
