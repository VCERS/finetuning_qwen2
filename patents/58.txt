Example 1
A lithium sulfide (Li2S) powder, a lithium oxide (Li2O) powder, a phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5) powder, a lithium chloride (LiCl) powder, and a lithium bromide (LiBr) powder were weighed according to the preparation composition shown in Table 1 below such that the total amount of the powders was 5 g. A slurry was prepared by adding 10 mL of heptane to these powders. The slurry was placed in a planetary ball mill. ZrO2 balls having a diameter of 10 mm were used as milling media. The ball mill was operated at 100 rpm for 10 hours for mixing. The resulting mixture was fired in an argon atmosphere at 500° C. for 4 hours, to thereby obtain a solid electrolyte. The lithium ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte was measured as in “Evaluation 4” described later and, as a result, found to be 3.6 mS/cm.

Table 1 shows the preparation composition for Example 1:

|Element| Amount (g)|
|---|---|
|Li2S| 2.1|
|Li2O| 0.5|
|P2S5| 1.0|
|LiCl| 0.5|
|LiBr| 0.5|
