The original text of the first example is:

(Example 1A) A planetary ball mill machine (trade name: Classic Line P-7, manufactured by Fritsch) was installed. Weigh 0.598 g of lithium sulfide, 0.867 g of diphosphorus pentasulfide, 0.271 g of lithium bromide, and 0.264 g of iodine, put them in a container for a planetary ball mill (45 cc, made of zirconia), and further dehydrate toluene. 4 g (water content: 10 ppm or less) was added, and the container was completely sealed. This container was attached to the above-mentioned planetary ball mill machine, and mixed, stirred, and pulverized at the same time for 40 hours at a base rotation speed of 500 rpm to prepare a sulfide-based solid electrolyte. To the obtained slurry-like product containing an amorphous sulfide-based solid electrolyte and a solvent, 5 ml of dehydrated toluene was added in a glove box and collected in a metal bat, and the powder (solid electrolyte) was precipitated. After that, the solvent of the supernatant was removed. Then, the precipitated powder was placed on a hot plate and dried at 80 ° C. to obtain a powdery amorphous sulfide-based solid electrolyte. The powdered amorphous sulfide-based solid electrolyte was subjected to powder X-ray analysis (XRD) measurement using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) apparatus (SmartLab apparatus, manufactured by Rigaku Co., Ltd.). It was found that there was no peak other than the peak derived from the raw material. The X-ray analysis spectrum is shown in Fig. 1.

The obtained powdery amorphous sulfide-based solid electrolyte was heated at 203 ° C. for 3 hours using a hot plate placed in a glove box. The powder after heating was subjected to powder X-ray analysis (XRD) measurement using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) apparatus (SmartLab apparatus, manufactured by Rigaku Co., Ltd.). The X-ray analysis spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, crystallization peaks were detected at 2θ = 19.9 ° and 23.6 °, confirming that a crystalline sulfide-based solid electrolyte was obtained.

The obtained powdery amorphous sulfide-based solid electrolyte was subjected to a differential thermal analyzer (DTA device) (thermogravimetric analyzer "TGA / DSC1 (model number)", STAR e software, all manufactured by METTTLER TOREO Co., Ltd.). The differential thermal analysis (DTA) was performed under a nitrogen gas atmosphere from room temperature to 500 ° C. under a heating condition of 10 ° C./min. The differential thermal analysis chart (DTA chart) is shown in Fig. 6. According to Fig. 6, an endothermic peak (P 380 ) having a peak top at 380 ± 15 ° C. at 384 ° C., an endothermic peak (P 406 ) having a peak top at 406 ° C., and an endothermic peak (P 406 ) having a peak top at 427 ° C. 427 ) and an endothermic peak (P 441 ) having a peak top at 441 ° C., and the absolute value of the amount of heat of each endothermic peak is 15.18 (J / g) for H 380 and 5.72 (J / g) for H 406. J / g), H 427 was 0.63 (J / g), H 441 was 1.37 (J / g), and the ratio (H 380 / H 350-450 ) was 66.3%.

The obtained amorphous sulfide-based solid electrolyte is subjected to differential thermal analysis (DTA) in the same manner as in Example 1B under a nitrogen gas atmosphere under a temperature rising condition of 10 ° C./min from room temperature to 500 ° C. It was. The differential thermal analysis chart (DTA chart) is shown in Fig. 6. According to Fig. 6, an endothermic peak (P 380 ) having a peak top at 380 ± 15 ° C. at 384 ° C., an endothermic peak (P 406 ) having a peak top at 406 ° C., and an endothermic peak (P 406 ) having a peak top at 427 ° C. 427 ) and an endothermic peak (P 441 ) having a peak top at 441 ° C., and the absolute value of the amount of heat of each endothermic peak is 15.18 (J / g) for H 380 and 5.72 (J / g) for H 406.
