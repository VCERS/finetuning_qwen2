The original text of the first example is as follows:

**Example 1**

Li2S powder, P2S5 powder, and LiBr powder were weighed so as to have the composition shown in Table 1 below. These powders were pulverized and mixed using a planetary ball mill (P-5 manufactured by Fritsch Corporation) to obtain a raw material composition. The obtained raw material composition is calcined to obtain a calcined product. Roasting is carried out using a tubular electric furnace. During firing, nitrogen gas was circulated in the electric furnace. The calcination temperature was set at 500Â° C., and the calcination was performed for 4 hours. The calcined product was pulverized by a ball mill to obtain the target solid electrolyte powder. As a result of XRD measurement, it was confirmed that the powder had a crystal phase of argentite-type crystal structure.

**Table 1** (omitted for brevity)

The text describes the preparation of a solid electrolyte through a series of steps involving the selection and weighing of powders, their mixing and pulverization, calcination, and further pulverization. The resulting powder was confirmed to have an argentite-type crystal structure via XRD measurement.
