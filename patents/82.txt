The original text of the first example is:

[Example 1]
A composite solid electrolyte was produced in the same manner as Example 3, except that Li6.4La3Zr1.4Nb0.6O12 was used as the oxide-based solid electrolyte in place of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Nb0.6O12.
Li6.4La3Zr1.4Nb0.6O12 was synthesized in a temperature range of from 500 to 1300°C, using LiOH(H2O) (manufactured by: Sigma-Aldrich), La(OH)3 (manufactured by: Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.), ZrO2 (manufactured by: Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.) and Nb2O5 (manufactured by: Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.) as starting materials. It was confirmed by SEM that the average particle diameter of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Nb0.6O12 is about 10 μm.

The text describes the synthesis of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Nb0.6O12, which is then used as the oxide-based solid electrolyte in the production of a composite solid electrolyte. The text does not specify the exact method for producing the composite solid electrolyte, but mentions that it involves mixing the oxide-based solid electrolyte with a sulfide-based solid electrolyte and compacting the resulting powder mixture.
