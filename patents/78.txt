Based on the provided text, the original text of the first example is:

Example 1:
The compound a and the compound B were mixed in a mortar to obtain a solid electrolyte (sample). At this time, the content of compound B in the solid electrolyte (sample) was set to 1 mass%.

Example 2:
A solid electrolyte (sample) was obtained in the same manner as in example 1, except that the content of the compound B was 5% by mass.

Example 3:
A solid electrolyte (sample) was obtained in the same manner as in example 1, except that the content of the compound B was 10 mass%.

Example 4:
A solid electrolyte (sample) was obtained in the same manner as in example 1, except that the content of the compound B was 20 mass%.

Example 5:
A solid electrolyte (sample) was obtained in the same manner as in example 1, except that the content of the compound B was 50% by mass.

So the first example is Example 1, where the compound a and compound B were mixed to make a solid electrolyte sample with 1 mass% of compound B.
