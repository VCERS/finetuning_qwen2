The original text of the first example is:

Lithium sulfide (Li2S, manufactured by Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd.), diphosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5, manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich Co., Inc.), germanium sulfide (GeS2, manufactured by Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.), and lithium bromide (LiBr, manufactured by Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.) were used as starting raw materials. The powders of these substances were mixed at the weight proportions indicated in the following Table 1 in a glove box in an argon atmosphere, and thus a raw material composition was obtained. Next, 1 g of the raw material composition was introduced into a pot (45 ml) made of zirconia together with zirconia balls (10 mmφ), 10 balls), and the pot was completely sealed (argon atmosphere). This pot was mounted on a planetary ball milling machine (P7™ manufactured by Fritsch Japan Co., Ltd.), and mechanical milling was carried out for 40 hours at a speed of table rotation of 370 rpm. Thereby, an amorphized ion conductive material was obtained.

Next, a powder of the ion conductive material thus obtained was introduced into a carbon-coated quartz tube, and the tube was vacuum-sealed. The pressure of the vacuum-sealed quartz tube was about 30 Pa. Subsequently, the quartz tube was installed in a calcining furnace, and the temperature was increased from room temperature to 400° C. over 6 hours, maintained at 400° C. for 8 hours, and then slowly decreased to room temperature. Thereby, a sulfide solid electrolyte material having a composition of 0.11 (LiBr).(Li3.35Ge0.35P0.65S4) was obtained.
