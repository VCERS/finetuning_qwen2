Example 1: Production and evaluation of Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.25 Nb 0.25 O 12 crystal by FZ method

(1) Mixing of raw materials:
First, lithium carbonate Li 2 CO 3 (manufactured by Rare Metallic, purity 99.99%) 8.1867 g, lanthanum oxide La 2 O 3 (Rare Metallic, purity 99.99%) 11.8982 g, zirconium oxide ZrO 2 (Rare Metallic, purity 99.99%) 4.5007 g, tantalum oxide Ta 2 O 5 (Rare Metallic, purity 99.99%) 2.0179 g, niobium oxide Nb 2 O 5 (Rare Metallic, purity 99.99%) 0.4054 g were mixed in an agate mortar using a wet method with ethanol. The lanthanum oxide was pre-baked at 900 °C in advance. The metal molar ratio Li: La: Zr: Ta: Nb of this mixture is less than the stoichiometric ratio of the target product, Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.25 Nb 0.25 O 12, with 40 mol% excess lithium. That is, the quantity ratio of the mixture of raw materials corresponds to the chemical composition of Li 9.1 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.25 Nb 0.25 O 12.

(2) Production of rod-shaped raw material:
A rod-shaped raw material was produced by the following procedure using the powder that passed through the sieve in the above step. First, 20.122 g of this powder was filled in a rubber mold and deaerated. Next, this mold was put in water in a sealed state and maintained at 40 MPa for 5 minutes. And after reducing the pressure of water, the molded object was taken out from the mold. The molded body had a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 1.0 cm and a height of 7.3 cm. Next, this cylindrical molded body was fired at 1150 °C using a box-type electric furnace (Denken, model number KDF009). The removed molded body had a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 0.92 cm and a height of 6.7 cm.

(3) Crystal growth of Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.25 Nb 0.25 O 12:
First, a four-elliptic infrared condensing heating furnace (FZ furnace) equipped with a 1 kW halogen lamp (Crystal) was used to place the rod-shaped raw material obtained in the above process in a system (FZ-T-10000H type, manufactured by System Co., Ltd.) to create a dry air atmosphere. Next, a rod-shaped raw material was heated at an output of 27.9% while rotating at 30 rpm on a surface perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. After a while, a part of the polycrystalline sample melted to form a melted part.
Then, the rod-shaped raw material mounting table was lowered at a moving speed of 14 mm/h to form a high-density Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.25 Nb 0.25 O 12 crystal (hereinafter "Sample 1"). The chemical composition of Sample 1 was analyzed by X-ray crystal structure analysis. The appearance of Sample 1 is shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, a high-density Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.25 Nb 0.25 O 12 crystal having a length of 6 cm was produced.

(4) Evaluation of crystal of Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.25 Nb 0.25 O 12:
A single-crystal X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, R-AXIS RAPID-II, AFC-7S) was used to examine the structure of Sample 1. The X-ray diffraction pattern of Sample 1 is shown in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, a clear diffraction point could be measured. Further, when the diffraction intensity data of Sample 1 was collected and the crystal structure was examined by the crystal structure analysis program Jana 2006, it was found that Sample 1 belongs to a cubic crystal. Sample 1 was cut with a diamond cutter to produce two thin pieces having a thickness of about 0.1 mm, and their relative densities were calculated by the method described above. As a result, their relative densities were 99.8% and 100%, respectively.

A line scan of 00L (0 <L <8.5) of sample 1 measured using a single crystal X-ray diffractometer is shown in Figure 3, and a line of 0KL (K = L, 0 <K, L <8.5) is shown in each scan in Figure 4. In Li 7-xy La 3 Zr 2-xy Ta x Nb y O 12 (xy ≠ 0) reported so far, the space group showing the symmetry of the crystal structure is Ia-3d in HM notation. In this space group Ia-3d, based on annihilation measurements, diffraction is observed only when L is a multiple of 4 at 00L and only when K and L are even numbers at 0KL.

However, in Figure 3, 00L is represented by 002, 006 and L = 2 + 4n (n is an integer), and in Figure 4, 0KL is represented by 011, 033, 055, 077, K = L, and K and L are represented by odd numbers. Diffraction lines were observed in the reflection index. These diffraction lines are not originally observed. Therefore, it is suggested that the space group of the sample 1 is lower symmetric than Ia-3d. However, since the diffraction intensity was extremely weak, it could not be reflected in the crystal structure analysis of Sample 1. For this reason, the crystal structure analysis was performed as Ia-3d.

Figure 5 schematically shows the crystal structure of Sample 1. Various cubic garnet-related structures reported so far have two types of lithium ion seats (24d seats and 96h seats) in the crystal structure. It had one type of lithium ion seat (two 96h seats). That is, in Sample 1, lithium was present in only one type of ion seat having 96 hours. Specifically, Li (x, y, z) was (0.601, 0.189, 0.072) and (0.771, 0.113, 0.025). Since the R factor indicating the reliability of the crystal structure analysis was 2.10%, the crystal structure analysis result is appropriate.

Moreover, this lithium ion arrangement occupying only 96 h seats is closer to the distance between the lithium ions than the cubic garnet-related structures reported so far. For this reason, it is thought that the lithium ion conductivity of Sample 1 is higher than other cubic garnet-related structural compounds. Sample 1 was cut to produce a flake having a diameter of about 0.7 cm and a thickness of about 0.09 cm. Electrodes were formed on the front side and the back side of the thin piece by sputtering gold having a diameter of 0.20 cm and a thickness of 40 nm. When this sample was measured for lithium ion conductivity by an alternating current impedance method (measuring device: Solarton, 1260) at 25 °C. in a nitrogen atmosphere, a Nyquist plot as shown in Figure 6 was obtained, and 1.1 × 10 −3 S / cm.

Using the reflection observed in the single crystal X-ray diffraction measurement of Sample 1, the lattice constant a was determined by the least square method, and a = 1.29670 nm ± 0.00003 nm. From this lattice constant, it was found that Sample 1 was a lithium composite oxide having a garnet-related structure. The result of pulverizing Sample 1 and performing powder X-ray diffraction measurement is shown in Figure 7. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of Sample 1 is the cubic garnet-related structure Li 7-xy La 3 Zr 2-xy Ta x Nb y O 12 (0.2 ≦ x + y) reported so far. It was the same as the pattern of ≦ 1). The lattice constant a calculated from the result of the powder X-ray structural analysis was a = 1.29595076 ± 0.000005 nm. When the results of the single crystal X-ray diffraction measurement and the powder X-ray structure analysis are combined, the lattice constant “a” of sample 1 is 1.290507 nm ≦ a ≦ 1.297070 nm.
