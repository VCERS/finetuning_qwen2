Example 1

Lithium sulfide (purity 98.5%) prepared in Preparation Example 1, diphosphorus pentasulfide (manufactured by Thermophos, purity 99.9% or more), lithium chloride (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99%) and lithium bromide (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., Purity of 99%) was used as a starting material (hereinafter, in all Examples, the purity of each starting material is the same). The mol ratio of lithium sulfide (Li 2 S), diphosphorus pentasulfide (P 2 S 5 ), lithium chloride (LiCl) and lithium bromide (LiBr) (Li 2 S : P 2 S 5 : LiCl : LiBr) is 47.5 : 12.5 : Each raw material was mixed so that it might become 30:10. Specifically, 0.461 g of lithium sulfide, 0.587 g of phosphorus pentasulfide, 0.269 g of lithium chloride, and 0.183 g of lithium bromide were mixed to obtain a raw material mixture.

The raw material mixture and 30 g of zirconia balls having a diameter of 10 mm were placed in a planetary ball mill (manufactured by Frich, Model No. P-7) zirconia pot (45 ml), and completely sealed. The inside of the pot was set to an argon atmosphere. The rotational speed was 370 rpm with a planetary ball mill, and the treatment (mechanical milling) was carried out for 48 hours to obtain a glassy powder (intermediate).

About 1.5 g of the powder of the above intermediate is filled into a Tamman tube (PT2, manufactured by Tokyo Glass Machinery Co., Ltd.) in a glove box under Ar atmosphere, the entrance of the Tamman tube is blocked with quartz wool, and the atmosphere is again prevented from entering the sealed container made of SUS. sealed so as not to Thereafter, an airtight container was placed in an electric furnace (FUW243PA, manufactured by Adovatech Co., Ltd.) and heat-treated. Specifically, the temperature was raised from room temperature to 500°C at 2.5°C/min (heated to 500°C for 3 hours), and maintained at 500°C for 10 hours. Then, it cooled slowly to obtain a sulfide solid electrolyte.

The ion conductivity (σ) of the sulfide solid electrolyte was 7.9 mS/cm. In addition, the electron conductivity was less than 10 -6 S/cm.

The XRD pattern of the sulfide solid electrolyte is shown in FIG. 1. At 2θ = 15.4, 17.8, 25.4, 29.9, 31.3, 44.9, 47.8, and 52.3 deg, peaks derived from the aramidite-type crystal structure were observed. On the other hand, a peak derived from the Li 3 PS 4 crystal structure was not observed.

The sulfide solid electrolyte was subjected to ICP analysis to determine the molar ratio of each element. In addition, the ionic conductivity (σ) was measured. A result is shown in Table 1.
