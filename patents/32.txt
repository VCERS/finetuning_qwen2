**Example 1**

The following describes a method for synthesizing and evaluating a solid electrolyte in this example.

**[Production of Solid Electrolyte Material]**

In a glove box kept in a dry and low-oxygen atmosphere having a dew point of-90°C or lower and an oxygen value of 5ppm or lower, Li: y: br: cl = 3: 1: 6-x: x, raw material powder LiBr, YBr are weighed3LiCl and YCl3. They were pulverized and mixed in a mortar. Then, the mixture was ground at 600rpm for 25 hours using a planetary ball millAnd (6) processing.

In this example, the values of x are 4.5, 5, and 5.5, which are examples 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3, respectively.

As described above, the solid electrolyte material Li of example 1 was obtained3YBr6-xClxThe powder of (4).

**[Evaluation of Structure of Solid Electrolyte Material]**

The synthesized solid electrolyte material was evaluated by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) in an environment maintained in a dry atmosphere at a dew point of-40°C or lower. For the X-ray source, Cu-K alpha rays are used. That is, Cu-Ka radiation (wavelength) is used(i.e., 0.15405nm) and(i.e., 0.15444nm) as X-rays, X-ray diffraction was measured by the theta-2 theta method. As a result, the same peak pattern was obtained for all the materials synthesized in examples 1-1 to 1-3. As a typical XRD peak pattern of embodiment 1, Li, which is example 1-2, was used3YBrCl5The peak pattern of (a) is shown in fig. 5. Table 1 shows the positions of a plurality of peaks (i.e., XRD peak angles) having XRD peak patterns with 2. theta. values in the range of 10 to 50 degrees in examples 1-1 to 1-3.

**[Evaluation of Lithium Ion Conductivity]**

Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram showing an evaluation method of ion conductivity. The press molding die 300 is composed of an electrically insulating polycarbonate frame die 301, an electrically conductive stainless steel punch upper portion 303, and a punch lower portion 302.

Using the structure shown in fig. 4, the ion conductivity was evaluated by the following method. The powder of the solid electrolyte material of example 1 (example of the solid electrolyte particle 100) was filled in a pressure molding die 300 in a glove box maintained in a dry and low-oxygen atmosphere having a dew point of-90°C or lower and an oxygen value of 5ppm or lower, and uniaxially pressurized at 400MPa to prepare a conductivity cell of example 1. Lead wires were drawn from the punch upper part 303 and the punch lower part 302, respectively, in a pressurized state, and connected to a potentiostat (VersaSTAT 4, Princeton Applied Research) equipped with a frequency response analyzer, and the ionic conductivity at room temperature was measured by electrochemical impedance measurement.

The ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte material of example 1 measured at 22°C is shown in table 1 below.

**[Evaluation of Phase Transition]**

Fig. 7 is a graph showing the temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte. FIG. 7 shows the measurement results of example 1-2. The results shown in FIG. 7 were measured by the following method. The same measurement was carried out for the other examples 1-1 and 1-3. As a result, in all of examples 1-1 to 1-3, a sharp change in conductivity indicating a phase change (i.e., a phase transition) was not observed in the temperature range of-30°C to 80°C.

**[Evaluation of Composition]**

The composition of the solid electrolyte material of example 1 was evaluated by ICP (inductively coupled Plasma) emission spectrometry. As a result, the deviations of Li/Y from the charge compositions in examples 1-1 to 1-3 were within 3%. As a result, it can be considered that the charging composition of the planetary ball mill and the composition of the solid electrolyte material described in the examples are almost the same.
