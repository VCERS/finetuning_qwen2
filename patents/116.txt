In a dry atmosphere with a dew point of −40 ° C. or lower, the raw materials LiI and ZrI 4 were weighed so that the molar ratio was LiI: ZrI 4 = 2: 1. These were crushed in a mortar and mixed to obtain a mixture. A zirconia pod was filled with 5 g of the mixture and 72 g of 5 mmφZr balls and treated with a mechanochemical treatment at 600 rpm for 100 hours using a planetary ball mill. From the above, the powder of the solid electrolyte material of Example 1 containing the crystal phase was obtained.
