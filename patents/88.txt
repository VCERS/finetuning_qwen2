**Embodiment 1-1~1-3**

As initiation material, lithium sulfide (Li2) and phosphoric sulfide (P2S5). In glove box under an argon atmosphere, with for xLi2S·(100-x)P2S5 the mode of the composition mol ratio that reaches x=70 weigh these powder, in agate mortar mixing, obtains feedstock composition. Then, by the zirconium oxide tank of resulting feedstock composition 1g inputs 45ml, then oxygen is put into change zirconium ball (Φ 10mm, 10), tank is completely closed. The tank is installed on planetary ball mill, is carried out with rotating speed 370rpm the mechanical lapping of 40 hours, obtains sulfide solid electrolyte material (embodiment 1-1).

In addition, except making xLi2S·(100-x)P2S5 composition in x values be changing into respectively beyond x=75,80, it is same with embodiment 1-1 to operate, obtain sulfide solid electrolyte material (embodiment 1-2,1-3).

This example demonstrates the production of a sulfide solid electrolyte material using lithium sulfide (Li2) and phosphoric sulfide (P2S5) as starting materials. The materials are mixed in a specific mol ratio, and then subjected to mechanical lapping under controlled conditions to produce the final sulfide solid electrolyte material. Different compositions are tested to observe their effects on the produced material.
