The original text of the first example is as follows:

Example 1

Lithium sulfide (purity 98.5%), diphosphorus pentasulfide (manufactured by Thermoforce, purity 99.9% or more) and lithium chloride (manufactured by Sigma Aldrich, purity 99%) prepared in Preparation Example 1 were used as starting materials (hereinafter, In all examples, the purity of each starting raw material is the same). Each raw material was prepared so that the molar ratio (Li 2 S : P 2 S 5 : LiCl) of lithium sulfide ( Li 2 S), diphosphorous pentasulfide (P 2 S 5 ), and lithium chloride (LiCl) was 1.9: 0.5: 1.6. Mixed. Specifically, 0.492 g of lithium sulfide, 0.626 g of diphosphorus pentasulfide, and 0.382 g of lithium chloride were mixed to form a raw material mixture.

The raw material mixture and 30 g of zirconia balls with a diameter of 10 mm were placed in a zirconia pot (45 ml) of a planetary ball mill (manufactured by Fritsch, model number P-7) and completely sealed. The inside of the pot was set in an argon atmosphere. It was processed (mechanical milling) for 72 hours using a planetary ball mill at a rotation speed of 370 rpm to obtain a glassy powder (intermediate).

Approximately 1.5 g of the powder of the above intermediate was filled into a tamman tube (PT2, manufactured by Tokyo Glass Equipment Co., Ltd.) in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere, and the entrance of the tamman tube was blocked with quartz wool to prevent air from entering the sealed container made of SUS. It was sealed to prevent it. After that, the sealed container was placed in an electric furnace (FUW243PA, manufactured by Adovantec) and heat treated. Specifically, the temperature was raised from room temperature to 430°C at 2.5°C/min and maintained at 430°C for 8 hours. After that, it was slowly cooled to obtain a sulfide solid electrolyte.

The ion conductivity (σ) of the sulfide solid electrolyte was 10.6 mS/cm. Additionally, the electronic conductivity was less than 10 -6 S/cm.

The XRD pattern of the sulfide solid electrolyte is shown in Figure 1. Peaks originating from the babyrhodite-type crystal structure were observed at 2θ = 15.64, 18.06, 25.66, 30.20, 31.58, 40.04, 41.12, 45.24, 49.16, 52.74, 55.36, 56.22, and 59.56 deg. Meanwhile, peaks originating from the Li 3 PS 4 crystal structure were not observed.

The sulfide solid electrolyte was subjected to ICP analysis to measure the molar ratio of each element. In addition, the lattice constant of the agyrhodite-type crystal structure contained in the sulfide solid electrolyte, the peak intensity ratio of the peaks of the LiCl and Li 3 PS 4 crystal structures in XRD, and the ionic conductivity σ were measured. The results are shown in Table 4. Additionally, the area ratio of each peak in the solid 31 P-NMR spectrum of the sulfide solid electrolyte was measured. The results are shown in Table 5.

Additionally, Figure 2 shows the solid-state 31 P-NMR spectrum of the sulfide solid electrolyte obtained in Example 1.
