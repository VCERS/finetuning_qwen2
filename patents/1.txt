The original text of the first example is as follows:

Using lithium sulfide (Li2S) powder, diphosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5) powder, and lithium chloride (LiCl) powder so that the raw material composition (mol%) shown in Table 1 is obtained, the total amount Each was weighed to 5 g and pulverized and mixed for 15 hours with a ball mill to prepare a mixed powder. The mixed powder is filled in a carbon container, and this is heated at a temperature rising / lowering rate of 200 °C./h while circulating 1.0 L / min of hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S, purity 100%) in a tubular electric furnace. Baked at 500 °C. for 4 hours. Thereafter, the sample was crushed with a mortar and sized with a sieve having an opening of 53 μm to obtain a powdery sample. At this time, the above weighing, mixing, setting in the electric furnace, taking out from the electric furnace, crushing and sizing operations are all performed in the glove box substituted with sufficiently dried Ar gas (dew point -60 °C. or lower).

Therefore, the first example involves preparing a lithium ion battery solid electrolyte by mixing lithium sulfide, diphosphorus pentasulfide, and lithium chloride powders in specific proportions, then firing the mixture in a hydrogen sulfide gas flow at 500°C for 4 hours. The resulting powder is then crushed and sieved to obtain the final solid electrolyte material.
