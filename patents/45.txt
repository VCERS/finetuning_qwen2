Based on the description in the document, the original text of the first example of how the electrolyte is produced involves the following key steps:

1. Calcinate a lithium metal composite oxide powder to obtain a calcined powder. This powder has an average particle diameter of 12.5 μm and a particle size distribution index [(d90-d10)/average particle diameter] of 0.80.

2. Add boric acid to the calcined powder. The amount of boric acid is set so that the boron content in the boric acid is 3 mol% based on the total amount of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and aluminum (Al) in the calcined powder.

3. Mix the calcined powder with 10% water by mass. 

4. Dry the mixture at 100°C in a vacuum atmosphere for 12 hours, then raise the temperature to 190°C and dry for another 10 hours. 

5. After drying, the resulting product is found to contain lithium borate (LiBO2) as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

6. The amount of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) remaining in the final product is measured by titration. It is found to be 0.003-0.5 mass% of lithium (Li) relative to the total amount of the product.

7. The resulting positive electrode active material shows good stability in paste viscosity over time, high initial discharge capacity, and low positive electrode resistance when used in a coin-type battery.

So in summary, the first example involves adding boric acid to a lithium metal composite oxide calcined powder, drying the mixture, and obtaining a positive electrode active material with controlled lithium hydroxide content that leads to stable paste properties and good battery performance.
