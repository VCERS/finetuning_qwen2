(1) Production of Sulfide Solid Electrolyte
A Li2S powder, a P2S5 powder, a LiCl powder, a LiBr powder and a MgS powder were weighed so that the composition would be Li4.8Mg0.6PS4.7Cl0.8Br0.8 and the total amount would be 5 g. To the mixture of these powders, heptane was added, and the mixture was pulverized and mixed for 10 hours using a wet pulverization mixing ball mill, and then dried in vacuum with a vacuum dryer to obtain a raw material powder. The resulting raw material powder was filled in a carbon container (40 mm×30 mm×20 mm, non-airtight) to a volume of 80 vol % and heated in a tubular electric furnace at 300° C. (product temperature) for 4 hours, and further heated at 500° C. (product temperature) for 4 hours while hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S) was circulated at 1.0 L/min to obtain a sintered product. The temperature rise and fall rate was 200° C/hour. The sintered product thus obtained was subjected to crude pulverization using a mortar, and heptane was added. The product was pulverized and mixed for 3 hours using a wet pulverization mixing ball mill, and then sized through a stainless sieve having a mesh size of 1 μm to obtain a powdery sulfide solid electrolyte. The additive element used in Example 1 is Mg (first ionization energy of Mg: 737.3 KJ/mol), and the molar ratio of the Mg content to the Li content is 0.125.
