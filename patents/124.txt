The original text of the first example is:

Example 1
The high-entropy oxide (Mg) for the lithium ion battery cathode material is prepared by adopting a laser molecular beam epitaxial deposition technology0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2) O film: high-energy ball milling magnesium oxide, cobalt oxide, nickel oxide, copper oxide and zinc oxide for 10-15 hours according to a molar ratio (0.2/0.2/0.2/0.2), uniformly mixing and tabletting to prepare a target material for laser molecular beam epitaxial deposition, carrying out frequency tripling on a 1064nm fundamental frequency generated by a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser to obtain 355nm pulse laser, focusing the laser beam by a lens and then irradiating the laser beam onto the target material, wherein the distance between the target material and a substrate is 30mm, and the high vacuum degree (1.0 multiplied by 10) is high-6Pa) on a substrate to obtain (Mg)0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2) O film, wherein the substrate is high-purity platinum sheetThe temperature was 700 â„ƒ.

The rest of the example details the process of electrochemical performance testing of the prepared film electrode, including the setup of the battery system, the use of the film electrode as the working electrode, and the testing of the charge-discharge cycle performance.
