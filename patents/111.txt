The original text of the first example is as follows:

Raw materials were weighed so as to have a predetermined composition in a glove box in an argon atmosphere, and mixed for 15 minutes using a mortar to prepare a mixed powder. Next, 1 g of the mixed powder was pelletized, sealed in a quartz ampoule in a vacuum tube, and fired together with the quartz ampoule at 600Â° C. for 8 hours to obtain a sulfide-based pellet having a composition of Li 6.4 P 0.8 B 0.2 S 5 I. A solid electrolyte was obtained. 0.2 g of this sulfide-based solid electrolyte powder was pressed at a pressure of 550 MPa to form a plate, and then a pellet with a diameter of 10 mm was prepared by attaching gold electrodes to both sides of the plate. AC impedance measurements were performed up to ~1 MHz to determine the ionic conductivity. Moreover, it was determined by XRD whether or not it had an aldirodite phase.
