The original text of the first example is:

"In a rotary evaporator, a 20% aqueous solution of lithium azide sold by Aldrich (registered trademark) was evaporated to dryness to obtain LiN3 colorless crystalline powder. In an agate mortar, 100 mg of LiN3 and 30 mg of carbon SP sold by TIMCAL were mixed.

In a Swagelok® electrochemical cell with a side path for the reference electrode, consisting of 10 mg LiN3 (7.7 mg) + carbon (2.3 mg) mixture working electrode, metallic lithium negative electrode and silver wire A reference electrode was attached. As electrolyte, a 1M solution of commercially available LiPF6 in an ethylene carbonate / dimethyl carbonate mixture (50/50 by weight) was introduced. A constant current calculated to allow extraction of one lithium equivalent of the LiN3 + carbon mixture within 10 hours is applied to the cell between the working and counter electrodes (421 μA). The change over time of the potential difference (Ewe -Eref) between the working electrode and the reference electrode was recorded. This is indicated by a curve a) in FIG. 1, in which Ewe −Eref (V) is indicated on the vertical axis, and time T (time) is indicated on the horizontal axis."
