In the comparative example 1,

a sulfide electrolyte Z, M is P, Q is S, X is Cl, a ═ 6, b ═ 1, c ═ 5, d ═ 1, i.e. of the general formula (Li ═ 1) a )(M b )(Q c )(X d ) Is Li 6 PS 5 Cl, its preparation method is as follows.

1) 42.7975g of Li are weighed out under the protection of argon atmosphere 2 S、41.4073g P 2 S 5 、15.7951g LiCl，Li 2 S、P 2 S 5 The purity of LiCl is more than 99 wt%.

2) Weighing Li at a ratio of 1:1 in an atmosphere with a water content of less than 10ppm at a rotation speed of 200rpm 2 S、P 2 S 5 And carrying out planetary ball milling and mixing on LiCl, and grinding for 4 hours to obtain a uniformly mixed powder primary material.

3) Taking out the primary powder, grinding again, and tabletting under 100MPa after uniform granularity to obtain the flaky primary powder.

4) Putting the sheet-shaped primary material into a sintering mold, putting the sintering mold into a sintering furnace, heating to 550 ℃ at the heating rate of 5 ℃/min, preserving heat for 16h, cooling to room temperature along with the sintering furnace, taking out the sheet-shaped sintering product under the condition that the water content is less than 10ppm, and grinding to obtain powder Li 6 PS 5 And (4) crystallizing Cl powder.

This example describes the preparation of a sulfide electrolyte Z with the formula Li 6 PS 5 Cl, where M is phosphorus (P), Q is sulfur (S), X is chlorine (Cl), and the values of a, b, c, and d are 6, 1, 5, and 1 respectively. The preparation involves weighing out lithium (Li), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and lithium chloride (LiCl) under argon atmosphere, followed by planetary ball milling and mixing, grinding, tabletting, sintering, and finally grinding to obtain the final product.
