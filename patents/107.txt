The original text of the first example is as follows:

(Production Example 1)

V2O5 (Aldrich), NH4H2PO4 (Junsei) and Super P were mixed by dry ball milling. At this time, the molar ratio of V2O5 and NH4H2PO4 was 1: 2, and the addition amount of Super P was 7 wt% based on the total weight of V2O5 and NH4H2PO4. The exact amounts of the compounds used are shown in Table 1 below.

Reagent name manufacturer Chemical formula (g / mol) amount Mass (g)
V2O5 Aldrich 181.88 0.05 moles 9.0494
NH4H2PO4 Junsei 115.03 0.1 moles 11.503
Super P Alfa Aesar 12.011 7 wt% 1.44

The resulting mixture was prepared by milling and then, four of VOPO yellow powder was heat-treated in air at a temperature of 750 °C for 4 hours (sample S1) dry ball for 24 hours.

X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using CuKα rays as an impurity The particle size was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The heat treatment temperature and measured present phase and particle size are shown in Table 2 below.

The target phase shown in Table 2 means β-VOPO4 having a three-dimensional structure consisting of VO6 hexahedron and PO4 tetrahedron.
