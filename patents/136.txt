The original text of the first example is as follows:

< examples 1 to 6>
In examples 1 to 6, aluminum fluoride (AlF) was added using lithium (Li) metal3) Modified aluminum fluoride is obtained.

[ production of modified aluminum fluoride ]
(weighing/premixing of raw materials)
Aluminum fluoride (AlF)3) And lithium (Li) metal were weighed in a total amount of 6.0g in molar ratios shown in table 1, and premixed with a mortar and pestle made of agate for about 1 hour to obtain a raw material mixed powder.

In addition, aluminum fluoride (AlF)3) And lithium (Li) metal, are extremely reactive with moisture, so the raw material weighing and premixing was carried out in a glove box (manufactured by Fujiu, Inc., model DBO-1.5BNK-SQ 1).
