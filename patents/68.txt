The discovery of crystals of the above-mentioned compound expands Li having a stable octahedral configuration3MX6The composition, structure and performance boundary of the system material promotes the further industrialized development of the high-safety all-solid-state lithium secondary battery.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, X is Cl, and a ═ 3, i.e., Li is the compound composition formula3YbCl6Having an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as shown in figure 1.

In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method for producing the above compound crystal, comprising:

weighing anhydrous YbX according to the proportion of the target composition3And LiX raw materials are uniformly mixed, and are heated to more than 400 ℃ under the condition of vacuum or inert atmosphere for solid-phase sintering.

For example, when the target composition is Li3YbCl6When the raw material is YbCl with the molar ratio of 1:33And LiCl.

After being mixed evenly, the mixture can be placed in a sealed quartz tube for vacuumizing or introducing inert gas.

When sintering is performed, the sintering is preferably performed at 400 to 650 ℃ for 4 to 18 hours.

And after sintering, cooling, grinding and crushing.

Due to no water YbX3LiX and LiaYbX3+aThe target products are easy to absorb moisture, and the weighing, mixing, grinding and crushing operations are performed in the preparation processPreferably under dry conditions, and if necessary in a water-and oxygen-free glove box.
