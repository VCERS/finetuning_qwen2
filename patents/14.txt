The original text of the first example is:

"In order to adjust the composition of a compound having a cubic argyrodite-type crystal structure to Li5.0PS4.4Cl1.2, a lithium sulfide (Li2S) powder, a diphosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5) powder, and a lithium chloride (LiCl) powder were respectively weighed so as to be 5 g in total amount, and then pulverized and mixed with a ball mill for 15 hours. The resulting mixed powder was filled in a container made of carbon, heated at 300° C. for 4 hours while allowing a hydrogen sulfide gas to flow at 1.0 l/min in a tubular electric furnace, and then further heated at 500° C. for 4 hours. The temperature rise and fall rate was set to 200° C./h. Subsequently, the sample was crushed in a mortar, and sieved through a sieve having an aperture diameter of 53 μm to obtain a powdery sample. At this time, all of the weighing, mixing, setting into an electric furnace, taking out from the electric furnace, crushing, and sieving were performed in a glove box purged with an Ar gas (dew point of −60° C. or lower) that was sufficiently dried, thereby obtaining a compound powder (sample) represented by a compositional formula: Li5.0PS4.4Cl1.2, that is, “x=1.6, y=0.4” in Li7−x−yPS6−aHax−y."

This example describes the synthesis of a specific sulfide solid electrolyte material, with the target composition being Li5.0PS4.4Cl1.2. The synthesis involves weighing and mixing lithium sulfide, diphosphorus pentasulfide, and lithium chloride powders, followed by heating in a hydrogen sulfide atmosphere to achieve the desired composition. The resulting powder is then processed to obtain a sample suitable for further characterization and testing.
