The original text of the first example is:

First, LiI-Li3PS4 was synthesized with a halogen-added sulfide solid electrolyte. Specifically, 0.64 g of Li2S, 1.03 g of P2S5 and 1.33 g of LiI were weighed so as to have a composition ratio of 35LiI-65 (0.75Li2S-0.25P2S5). 1.5 g of the mixed powder was sealed in an Ar (argon) atmosphere together with a ZrO2 ball (10 mm x 7.5 mm x 20) in a 45 ml ZrO2 pot and rotated at 380 rpm for 10 minutes at intervals of 5 minutes, was repeatedly subjected to mechanical milling reaction until it could not be detected by the X-ray diffraction method to synthesize LiI-Li3PS4 which is a halogen-added sulfide solid electrolyte.

Subsequently, sulfur, disulfide and activated carbon (specific surface area 3000 m2/g) were mixed in a bowl at a weight ratio of 15:15:20. 500 mg of the resulting mixture was sealed in an Ar (argon) atmosphere together with a ZrO2 ball (φ10 mm × 20, φ7.5 mm × 20) in a 45 ml ZrO2 pot and the rotation of 380 rpm for 45 minutes was repeated 17 times And repeated. The obtained mixture and the halogen-added sulfide solid electrolyte were weighed so as to be equal in weight and mixed in a bowl. 500 mg of the resulting mixture was sealed in an Ar (argon) atmosphere together with a ZrO2 ball (φ10 mm × 20, φ7.5 mm × 20) in a 45 ml ZrO2 pot and the rotation of 380 rpm for 45 minutes was repeated 17 times Thus, a positive electrode mixture was obtained. The weight ratio of each component of the positive electrode mixture was found to be a combination of sulfur, disulfide, activated carbon and halogen-added sulfide solid electrolyte of 15:15:20:50.
