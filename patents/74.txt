Example 1
(1) Preparation of Electrolyte Precursor [Sulfide Glass; Molar Rate: Li2S/P2S5/LiI=64.2/21.4/14.4] and Heat-Treated Electrolyte
As raw materials, 0.306 g (6.66×10−3 mol) of lithium sulfide produced in Production Example 1, 0.494 g (2.22×10−3 mol) of phosphorus pentasulfide (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.200 g (1.49×10−3 mol) of lithium iodide (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich) were used.
Powder obtained by mixing these and 10 balls made of zirconia, each having a diameter of 10 mm were put in an alumina pot of a planetary ball mill (P-7; manufactured by Fritsch) and completely closed. The operation was conducted in a glove box in an atmosphere of argon with a dew point of −80° C. or less.
For initial several minutes, the planetary ball mill was rotated at a low speed (85 rpm) to mix the blend powder sufficiently. Thereafter, the rotation speed of the planetary ball mill was raised gradually to 370 rpm. With the rotation speed of the planetary ball mill being 370 rpm, mechanical milling was conducted for 20 hours. The powder obtained by mechanical milling was evaluated by X-ray measurement. As a result, the powder was confirmed to be glass (sulfide glass).
The crystallization temperature (Tc) of the electrolyte precursor was 189° C. Tc was measured by DSC (differential scanning calorimeter).
The electrolyte precursor was heat-treated at 210° C. for 2 hours to prepare a heat-treated solid electrolyte (glass ceramic).

The key steps in this example are:
1. Mixing lithium sulfide, phosphorus pentasulfide, and lithium iodide in a planetary ball mill under an argon atmosphere.
2. Mechanical milling the mixture for 20 hours at 370 rpm to produce a sulfide glass electrolyte precursor.
3. Heating the precursor at 210°C for 2 hours to produce a heat-treated glass ceramic solid electrolyte.
