The original text of the first example is as follows:

(embodiment 1)
(sample making)
Weigh the Li that molar ratio is 85: 152S(Japan high-purity chemical studies made, model: LII06PB) and P2S5
(Aldrich system, model: 232106) it is high to weigh 1 mole of ZnS(Japan relative to 99 moles of the mixture for mixture
Purity chemical studies made, model: ZNI10PB).Zn is divalent, the Zn, Li of 0.28 containing all material weighed mole %
Molar ratio relative to P is 5.7.
The good all material of scale is put into planetary ball mill (Fritsch corporation), is crushed with the revolving speed of 350rpm
Mixing 6 hours.
To the mixed-powder, i.e., after carrying out XRD determining to solid lithium-ion conductive particle, do not occur significantly spreading out
Ejected wave peak, the as not no state of crystal phase, that is, be amorphous state.The solid lithium-ion conductive particle is put into tablet
In molding machine, by carrying out compression with tablet molding machine to obtain the pressurization powder of solid lithium-ion conductor.Take out pressurization powder
Body attaches it to the fixture for using the pressure of about 1MPa to pressurize thus as evaluation sample.Electrode is using stainless steel
(SUS).

(sample evaluation)
It is hindered within the scope of frequency 0.1Hz~1MHz by exchange using 1260 types and 1287 types of Solartron corporation
Anti- method implements evaluation sample obtained the measurement of ionic conductivity, and obtaining measured value later is 2.5 × 10-4S/cm.Separately
Outside, after with electronic conductivity of the direct current method to measure and evaluate sample, measured value obtained is 3.2 × 10-8S/cm, thus
Electron conductivity is that one kind can be with ignored level.
