The original text of the first example is:

[Example 1] Li 2 S powder, P 2 S 5 powder, LiCl powder and LiBr powder were used as raw material powders. These powders were weighed so as to have a composition of Li 5.4 PS 4.4 Cl 0.8 Br 0.8 and a total amount of 5 g. The Li 2 S powder, a Li 2 S reagent and purity 99.5% LiOH reagent purity of 99.9% purity was used a model raw material powder were mixed so that as shown in Table 1. The raw material powder was pulverized and mixed using a ball mill to obtain a mixed powder. The mixed powder was then fired. The firing was carried out in an atmosphere of 100% hydrogen sulfide gas. The flow rate was 100 cm 3 / min. The firing temperature was set to 500 ° C., and the firing time was 8 hours. In this way, a sulfide solid electrolyte having an algyrodite type crystal structure was obtained. It was confirmed by XRD measurement that it had an algyrodite type crystal structure.

In this example, the raw materials were weighed to achieve a specific composition, mixed using a ball mill, and then fired in a hydrogen sulfide atmosphere at 500°C for 8 hours to produce a sulfide solid electrolyte with an algyrodite type crystal structure.
