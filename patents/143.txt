Example 1
   LiH2PO4 and Ta2O5 were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio and pulverized using a mortar and the resultant was heated in the air at 600 °C for 8 hours, and then the mixture obtained therefrom was mixed again and heated at 1000 °C for 8 hours and the mixture obtained therefrom was pulverized using zirconium balls in toluene for 1 hour.
Then, the pulverized powder was compression-molded in the form of pellets each having a diameter of 1.05 cm and a thickness of 0.21 cm, and the pellets were sintered at 1050 °C for 12 hours. In this case, the pellets were sintered in a state of being covered with powder having the same composition to prevent the loss of lithium.
