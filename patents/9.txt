The original text of the first example is as follows:

Example 1 Lithium sulfide (purity 98.5%), diphosphorus pentasulfide (thermophos, purity 99.9% or higher), lithium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99%) and elemental sulfur (Sigma Aldrich Co., Ltd., purity 99.9%) was used as a starting material (hereinafter, the purity of each starting material is the same in all the examples). The mol ratio (Li 2 S: P 2 S 5 : LiCl: S) of lithium sulfide (Li 2 S), diphosphorus pentasulfide (P 2 S 5 ), lithium chloride (LiCl), and elemental sulfur (S) is 42. Each raw material was mixed so as to be.2: 11.1: 35.6: 11.1. Specifically, 0.464 g of lithium sulfide, 0.591 g of diphosphorus pentasulfide, 0.360 g of lithium chloride, and 0.085 g of elemental sulfur were mixed to prepare a raw material mixture.

The raw material mixture and 30 g of zirconia balls having a diameter of 10 mm were placed in a planetary ball mill (Fritsch, model number P-7) zirconia pot (45 mL) and completely sealed. The inside of the pot had an argon atmosphere. The powder (intermediate) was obtained by processing (mechanical milling) for 25 hours at a rotation speed of 370 rpm with a planetary ball mill. The results of XRD evaluation of the intermediate are shown in Figure. From the obtained XRD pattern, it was confirmed that most of them were glass. Approximately 1.5 g of the above intermediate powder is packed in a Tanman tube (PT2, manufactured by Tokyo Glass Equipment Co., Ltd.) in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere, the mouth of the Tanman tube is closed with quartz wool, and a SUS seal is used. The container was sealed to prevent air from entering. Then, the closed container was placed in an electric furnace (FUW243PA, manufactured by Advantech) and heat-treated. Specifically, the temperature was raised from room temperature to 520 째 C. at 2.5 째 C./min (raised to 520 째 C. in 3 hours) and maintained at 520 째 C. for 8 hours. Then, it was slowly cooled to obtain a sulfide solid electrolyte.
