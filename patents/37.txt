The original text of the first example is as follows:

Example 1
Lithium sulfide (Li2S, manufactured by Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd.), diphosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5, manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC.) and red phosphorus (P, manufactured by Kojundo Chemical Lab. Co., Ltd.) were used as a starting material. These powders were mixed in a glove box under an argon atmosphere at a ratio of 0.470526 g of Li2S, 0.515941 g of P2S5 and 0.013533 g of P to obtain a raw material composition. Thereafter, the obtained raw material composition was put in a carbon-coated quartz tube and vacuum-sealed. The pressure of the quartz tube for vacuum-sealing was approximately 30 Pa. Next, the quartz tube was placed in a burning furnace, heated from room temperature to 550° C. over 6 hours, maintained at 550° C. for 8 hours, and thereafter slowly cooled up to room temperature. Thus, a sample A was obtained.
Next, powder of the obtained sample A was ground by using vibrating mill. TI-100™ manufactured by Cosmic Mechanical Technology Co., Ltd. was used for vibrating mill. Specifically, 2 g of the sample A obtained by the method and a vibrator made of alumina (ϕ 36.3 mm, height 48.9 mm) were put in a 10-mL pot made of zirconia and treated at the number of revolutions of 1440 rpm for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the obtained powder was put in a carbon-coated quartz tube and vacuum-sealed. The pressure of the quartz tube for vacuum-sealing was approximately 30 Pa. Next, the quartz tube was placed in a burning furnace, heated from room temperature to 950° C. over 2 hours, maintained at 950° C. for 1 hour, and thereafter projected into iced water and quenched. Thus, a sample B (an amorphized ion conductive material) was obtained.
Next, powder of the obtained sample B was put in a carbon-coated quartz tube and vacuum-sealed. The pressure of the quartz tube for vacuum-sealing was approximately 30 Pa. Next, the quartz tube was placed in a burning furnace, heated from room temperature to 300° C. over 2 hours, maintained at 300° C. for 5 hours, and thereafter slowly cooled up to room temperature. Thus, a sulfide solid electrolyte material having a composition of Li3.75P0.93S4 was obtained.
