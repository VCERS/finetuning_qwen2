**Example 1**

A mixture containing 83 mol % Li6PS5I and 17 mol % LiBH4 was prepared.

---

This example involves the preparation of a compound by mixing lithium polysulfide (Li6PS5I) and lithium borohydride (LiBH4) in specific molar ratios. The preparation is carried out through a process called mechanosynthesis, which involves high-energy mechanochemical milling. The starting reagents are lithium sulfide (Li2S), phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5), lithium borohydride (LiBH4), and lithium chloride (LiCl) or lithium iodide (LiI) in stoichiometric amounts. The mixture is placed in a stainless steel container along with 25 balls (diameter 7 mm) and then tightly closed under argon in a glovebox. The milling is conducted using a planetary mill at a rotational speed of 600 rpm for 20 hours. This process allows chemical reactions to occur between each component, facilitating the incorporation of lithium borohydride into the compound.
