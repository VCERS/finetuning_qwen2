The first example of producing the solid electrolyte described in the text involves using lithium sulfide (Li2S) and diphosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5) as raw materials. The molar ratio of Li2S to P2S5 is adjusted to be in the range of 60:40 to 90:10, with a preferred range of 65:35 to 85:15 or 70:30 to 90:10. The total molar ratio of Li2S, P2S5, and a halogen-containing compound is adjusted to be in the range of 50:50 to 99:1, with a preferred range of 55:45 to 95:5.

The raw materials are mixed in a predetermined amount in a mortar, then pelletized, and placed in a carbon-coated quartz tube. The mixture is then heated at a predetermined reaction temperature, typically between 400°C to 1000°C, for a period of 0.1 hour to 12 hours. After the reaction, the solid electrolyte is obtained by quenching the reactants in ice or rapidly cooling them.

The resulting solid electrolyte is characterized by its ability to have a high ionic conductivity and resist hydrolysis. The text also mentions that the solid electrolyte can be produced using alternative methods such as mechanical milling (MM) or a slurry method, which can help control the composition and particle size distribution of the final product.

The text further explains that the solid electrolyte can be used in batteries, specifically as a constituent material for the positive electrode layer, electrolyte layer, or negative electrode layer. The solid electrolyte's properties make it suitable for use in high-dew point environments, which is a significant improvement over previous electrolyte materials.
