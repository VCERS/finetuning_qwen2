The original text of the first example is:

A method for producing a sulfide glass ceramic, including reacting a lithium compound, a phosphorus compound and a halogen compound in a solvent that contains a hydrocarbon and an ether compound to produce a sulfide glass that contains a Li element, a P element, a S element and one or more halogen elements, and heating the sulfide glass to produce a sulfide glass ceramic.

Specifically, in Example 1, a production apparatus was used that had a stirrer-equipped 1.5-liter glass reactor and a bead mill unit connected to it. The apparatus allowed the following mixture (slurry) to be circulated:

A mixture prepared by adding 1200 ml of dewatered toluene and 7.2 ml of dibutyl ether (DBE) to 29.7 g of lithium sulfide (LiOH content: 0.1% by mass or less), 47.8 g of diphosphorus pentasulfide, 15.4 g of lithium iodide and 15.0 g of lithium bromide.

This mixture was circulated between the reactor and the bead mill unit at a flow rate of 480 ml/min. The reactor was heated to 80°C, and the apparatus was operated with a peripheral speed of 12 m/s. After 48 hours, the apparatus was stopped, and the resulting slurry was processed to obtain a powdery sulfide glass. Then, the powdery sulfide glass was heated at 185°C for 3 hours to produce a sulfide glass ceramic. The residual solvent amount in the sulfide glass ceramic was measured, and the Li ion conductivity was also determined.
