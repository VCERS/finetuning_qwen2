The original text of the first example in the provided document describes the synthesis of a lithium-magnesium-nickel oxide composition, specifically Li1.05Mg0.025NiO2. The synthesis process involves the following steps:

1. **Preparation of the Precursor Compound**: The precursor compound is prepared by dry mixing lithium hydroxide (Li(OH)2), magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), and lithium nitrate (LiNO3). The amounts used are approximately 242.91 g of Li(OH)2, 14.79 g of Mg(OH)2, and 34.97 g of LiNO3.

2. **Mixing with Nickel Hydroxide**: The precursor compound is then mixed with high-density spherical nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) in a 1-liter jar. The exact amount of Ni(OH)2 used is not specified in the document.

3. **Sintering Process**: The mixture is placed in an alumina crucible and subjected to a sintering process. This involves heating the mixture at a rate of 5°C/min to 450°C, holding it at 450°C for 4 hours, and then raising the temperature to 700°C at a rate of 2°C/min, maintaining it at 700°C for 4 hours.

4. **Cooling and Grinding**: After the sintering process, the sample is naturally cooled to room temperature. It is then ground for 5 minutes to break up any aggregates and sieved through a No. 270 mesh to obtain a desired particle size of 10 μm.

5. **Characterization**: The resulting composition is characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, which indicates that the powder obtained is essentially free of impurities.

This example demonstrates the synthesis of a lithium-magnesium-nickel oxide composition with a specific formula, highlighting the use of lithium, magnesium, and nickel sources, along with the sintering process to achieve the desired composition.
