<< Inventive example 1 >>

[Production of Solid Electrolyte Material]
In an argon atmosphere with a dew point of -60°C or less, 493 mg of LiBr, 415 mg of YBr3, and 92 mg of YF3 were prepared and mixed. Subsequently, milling processing was performed at 500 rpm for 12 hours using a planetary ball mill.

[Analysis of Crystal Structure]
The results shown in FIG. 2 were measured by the following method.
In other words, for analysis of the crystal structure of the solid electrolyte, an X-ray diffraction pattern was measured in a dry environment having a dew point of -45°C or less using an X-ray diffraction device (manufactured by RIGAKU Corporation, MiniFlex 600). For the X-ray source, a Cu-Ka ray was used. In other words, X-ray diffraction was measured by a θ-2θ method using a Cu-Ka ray (wavelengths of 1.5405 Å and 1.5444 Å) as the X-ray.

In the X-ray diffraction pattern of the inventive example 1, peaks each having relatively high intensity were observed at 27.50°, 31.88°, 45.68°, 54.20°, and 56.90°.

The peak position of these peaks substantially accorded with a part of peak positions of the X-ray diffraction pattern observed from an LEB phase.

[Evaluation of Lithium Ion Conductivity]
A pressure-molding die 300 is composed of a frame 301 formed of an electronically insulating polycarbonate, and an upper punch part 303 and a lower punch part 302, both of which are formed of electron conductive stainless steel.

Ion conductivity was evaluated by the following method using the configuration shown in FIG. 4.
In a dry atmosphere with a dew point of -30°C or lower, the inside of the pressure-molding die 300 was filled with the powder of the solid electrolyte material of the inventive example 1, and was uniaxially pressed at 400 MPa to produce a conductivity measurement cell of the inventive example 1.

In a pressurized state, lead wires were routed from the upper punch part 303 and the lower punch part 302 and were connected to a potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, VersaSTAT 4) equipped with a frequency response analyzer. The ion conductivity at room temperature was measured by an electrochemical impedance measurement method.

The ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte material of the inventive example 1 measured at 22°C was 2.6 × 10-4 S/cm.
