The original text of the first example in the given document describes the synthesis and characterization of a lithium-rich anti-perovskite sulfide solid electrolyte material. The example focuses on synthesizing a lithium sulfide (Li2S) and lithium bromide (LiBr) based material, which is then characterized for its ionic conductivity.

### Key Steps in the First Example:

1. **Raw Material Preparation**: Lithium sulfide (Li2S) and lithium bromide (LiBr) are weighed in a 1:1 molar ratio and mixed homogeneously in an argon gas atmosphere glove box.

2. **Ball Milling**: The mixed powder is transferred to a sealed ball mill, where it undergoes low-speed rotation (100 rpm) for 20 minutes to ensure adequate mixing.

3. **High Pressure Synthesis**: The mixed powder is then subjected to high pressure synthesis using a cubic hinge press. Insulating parts are made from dolomite to maintain a stable reaction environment. Heating is conducted using steel caps, molybdenum sheets, graphite pipes, and graphite flakes to achieve the necessary high temperature. The sample is pressed at 5.0 GPa at 300Â°C for 30 minutes under insulation.

4. **Characterization**: After the synthesis, the sample is quenched to room temperature, slowly released, and then evaluated for its ionic conductivity. This is typically done using an AC impedance spectroscopy test.

### Key Features of the Material:

- **High Ionic Conductivity**: The synthesized material shows high ionic conductivity, which is crucial for its application as a solid electrolyte in batteries.

- **Stability**: The material is stable under various conditions, indicating its potential for use in a wide range of applications requiring high reliability.

- **Synthesis Methodology**: The use of high pressure and temperature, along with careful control of the synthesis environment, ensures the formation of the desired lithium-rich anti-perovskite sulfide structure.

### Conclusion:

The first example demonstrates a method for synthesizing a lithium-rich anti-perovskite sulfide solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, suitable for use in advanced battery technologies. The synthesis involves precise control of reaction conditions to achieve the desired material properties.
