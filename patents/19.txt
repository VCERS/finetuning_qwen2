The original text of the first example is:

As starting materials, lithium sulfide (Li2S, manufactured by Nippon Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), diphosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5, manufactured by Aldrich), silicon sulfide (SiS2, manufactured by High Purity Chemical Co., Ltd.), and chloride lithium (LiCl, manufactured by High Purity Chemical Laboratory) were used. These powders were mixed at a ratio shown in Table 1 below in a glove box under an argon atmosphere to obtain a raw material composition. Next, 1 g of the raw material composition was placed in a zirconia pot (45 ml) together with zirconia balls (10 mmφ, 10 pieces), and the pot was completely sealed (argon atmosphere). This pot was attached to a planetary ball mill (P7 made by Fritsch), and mechanical milling was performed at a base plate rotation speed of 370 rpm for 40 hours. Thereby, an amorphous ion conductive material was obtained.

Next, the obtained ion conductive material powder was placed in a carbon-coated quartz tube and vacuum-sealed. The pressure of the vacuum sealed quartz tube was about 30 Pa. Next, the quartz tube was placed in a baking furnace, heated from room temperature to 400 °C. over 6 hours, maintained at 400 °C. for 8 hours, and then gradually cooled to room temperature. As a result, a sulfide solid electrolyte material having a composition of 1.5 (LiCl) · (Li3.4 Si0.4 P0.6 S4) was obtained. The above composition is, y (LiCl) · (100 -y) (Li(4-x)Si(1-x)PxS4) in the x = 0.6, corresponding to a composition of y = 60.
