The original text of the first example is as follows:

≪Example A1≫ [Preparation of solid electrolyte material] In an argon atmosphere with a dew point of -60°C or lower, raw material powder LiCl, YCl3 and ZrCl4 were weighed so that the molar ratio was LiCl:YCl3:ZrCl4 = 2.5:0.5:0.5. did. Thereafter, milling was performed using a planetary ball mill at 600 rpm for 12 hours.

[Analysis of crystal structure] The results shown in Figure 4A were measured by the method described below.

That is, to analyze the crystal structure of the solid electrolyte, an X-ray diffraction pattern was measured in a dry environment with a dew point of -45° C. or lower using an X-ray diffraction device (RIGAKU MiniFlex 600). As for the X-ray source, Cu-Kα rays were used.

In Figure 4B, the horizontal axis 2θ of the above-mentioned XRD pattern is converted by q = 4πsin(θ)/λ, and the q value at the above-mentioned peak position 2θ = 31.64°, q2 = 2.222 Å−1. This is a diffraction pattern when the normalized value of q/q2 is plotted on the horizontal axis. In Figure 4B, peaks were observed at the positions of q/q2 = 0.507, 1.289, and 1.530. The q values of these peaks are set as q1/q2 = 0.507, q3/q2 = 1.289, and q4/q2 = 1.530, and the value of aave is calculated using equation (2). The calculated value was 5.232 Å. When a LiX is calculated using xCl = 1, xBr = 0, and xI = 0 in equation (3), and the value of aave/aLiX is calculated, aave/aLiX = 1.020.

[Preparation of secondary battery] In an argon glove box, the solid electrolyte material of Example A1 and LiCoO2 as an active material were weighed at a volume ratio of 70:30. A mixture was prepared by mixing these in an agate mortar.

In an insulating outer cylinder, the solid electrolyte material of Example A1 equivalent to a thickness of 700 μm, 8.5 mg of the above-mentioned mixture, and 16.5 mg of Al powder were laminated in this order. A first electrode and a solid electrolyte layer were obtained by press-molding this at a pressure of 300 MPa.

Next, metal In (thickness: 200 μm) was laminated on the side of the solid electrolyte layer opposite to the side in contact with the first electrode. By press-molding this at a pressure of 80 MPa, a laminate consisting of the first electrode, solid electrolyte layer, and second electrode was produced.

Next, stainless steel current collectors were placed above and below the laminate, and current collection leads were attached to the current collectors.

Finally, the inside of the insulating outer cylinder was isolated and sealed from the outside atmosphere using an insulating ferrule.

Through the above steps, a secondary battery of Example A1 was manufactured.

[Charge/discharge test] A charge/discharge test of the secondary battery of Example A1 was conducted in the following manner.

The secondary battery of Example A1 was placed in a constant temperature bath at 25°C.

Constant current charging was performed at a current value of 0.05 C rate (20 hour rate) with respect to the theoretical capacity of the battery, and charging was completed at a voltage of 3.6 V.

Next, the battery was discharged at a current value of the same rate of 0.05C, and the discharge was terminated at a voltage of 1.9V.

As a result of the above measurements, the initial discharge capacity of the secondary battery of Example A1 was 0.467 mAh.
