The original text of the first example is:

"Lithium sulfide (Li) was weighed so as to have a composition shown in table 1 below 2 S) powder, phosphorus pentasulfide (P) 2 S 5 ) Powder, lithium chloride (LiCl) powder and lithium bromide (LiBr) powder so as to be 5g in total. 10mL of heptane was added to the powder to prepare a slurry. The slurry was charged into a planetary ball mill apparatus having a capacity of 80 mL. ZrO with a diameter of 10mm was used 2 And (5) preparing balls as a medium. The mass ratio of the raw material powder to the medium (raw material powder/medium) was set to 0.05. The running condition of the ball mill apparatus was 370rpm, and mechanical milling was performed over 50 hours. Thereby obtaining a sulfide solid electrolyte."

This example describes the preparation of a sulfide solid electrolyte through mechanical milling of lithium sulfide (Li), phosphorus pentasulfide (P)2S5, lithium chloride (LiCl), and lithium bromide (LiBr) powders in a heptane slurry using a planetary ball mill apparatus. The milling conditions and the resulting lithium ion conductivity of the electrolyte are also mentioned.
