First, NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, LiNO<sub>3</sub>, and Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O are used as raw materials for Li<sub>2</sub>CoP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and the raw materials are weighed (s1). Then, citric acid and pure water are added to the raw material of Li<sub>2</sub>CoP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and mixed in a beaker (s1). At this time, depending on the sample, the ratio of each raw material so that the addition amount (wt%) of Li with respect to the stoichiometric ratio is different in terms of LiNO<sub>3</sub>, which is the raw material that is the origin of Li in the chemical formula Li<sub>2</sub>CoP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. Changed.
