Production Example
Li2S (manufactured by NIPPON CHEMICAL INDUSTIAL CO., LTD.), P2S5 (manufactured by Aldrich), LiI (manufactured by NIPPOH CHEMICALS CO., LTD.), and LiBr (manufactured by JAPAN PURE CHEMICAL CO., LTD.) were weighed so as to satisfy the composition of 10LiI·15LiBr·75 (0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5), and were mixed using an agate mortar for 5 minutes. Put in a vessel of planetary ball mill (45 cc, made of ZrO2) was 2 g of this mixture was, dehydrated heptane (a moisture amount of 30 ppm or less, 4 g) was put therein, and ZrO2 ball (ϕ=5 mm, 53 g) was put therein to hermetically seal the vessel completely. This vessel was mounted on a planetary ball mill machine (P7™ manufactured by FRITSCH JAPAN CO., LTD.) to perform mechanical milling for 20 hours at the number of weighing table revolutions of 500 rpm. Thereafter, drying at 110° C. was performed for 1 hour so as to remove heptane, thereby obtaining a coarse material of a sulfide solid electrolyte material.

Then, the obtained coarse material was pulverized into minute particles. Dehydrated heptane and dibutyl ether were mixed to the coarse material such that the total weight was adjusted to 10 g and the solid content concentration was adjusted to 10% by weight. The obtained mixture was put in a vessel of planetary ball mill (45 cc, made of ZrO2), and ZrO2 ball (ϕ=0.3 mm, 40 g) was put therein to hermetically seal the vessel completely. This vessel was mounted on a planetary ball mill machine (P7™ manufactured by FRITSCH JAPAN CO., LTD.) to perform mechanical milling for 20 hours at the number of weighing table revolutions of 150 rpm. Thereafter, drying was performed to obtain an amorphous sulfide solid electrolyte material (D50=0.8 μm).
