[Example 1-1]
As starting materials, lithium sulfide (Li2S, manufactured by Nippon Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd.), diphosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5, manufactured by Aldrich), and red phosphorus (P, manufactured by High Purity Chemical Laboratory) are used. These powders were mixed in a weight ratio shown in Table 1 in a glove box under an argon atmosphere to obtain a raw material composition. Next, 1 g of the raw material composition was placed in a zirconia pot (45 ml) together with zirconia balls (10 mmφ, 10 pieces), and the pot was completely sealed (argon atmosphere). This pot was attached to a planetary ball mill (P7 made by Fritsch), and mechanical milling was performed at a base plate rotation speed of 370 rpm for 40 hours. Next, the pot was opened, the sample adhered to the wall surface was collected, pulverized for 2 hours using a vibration mill (manufactured by CMT), and then returned to the pot again (homogenization treatment). Mechanical milling and homogenization were repeated a total of 3 times. Thereby, an amorphous ion conductive material was obtained.

The obtained ion conductive material was put in a carbon-coated quartz tube and vacuum-sealed. The pressure of the vacuum sealed quartz tube was about 30 Pa. Next, the quartz tube was placed in a firing furnace, heated from room temperature to 260 °C. over 6 hours, maintained at 260 °C. for 4 hours, and then gradually cooled to room temperature. Thereby, a sulfide solid electrolyte material having a composition of Li3.2PS4 was obtained. This composition corresponds to x = 0 and y = 0.1 in Li5x+2y+3P1-xS4.
