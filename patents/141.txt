Based on the document, the original text of the first example for producing the Li2S-P2S5-based sulfide solid electrolyte material is:

"As a starting material, lithium sulfide (Li2S) and phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5) were used. Those powders were weighed in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere (dew point −70° C.) so that the molar ratio was 75Li2S.25P2S5 and mixed in an agate mortar, and 1 g of a raw material composition (Li2S=0.3827 g and P2S5=0.6173 g) was obtained. Then, 1 g of the obtained raw material composition was introduced into a zirconia pot of 45 ml, ten zirconia balls (φ10 mm) were further introduced, and the pot was completely sealed (Ar atmosphere). The pot was attached to a planetary ball mill machine (P7™ manufactured by Fritsch Japan Co., Ltd.), mechanical milling was performed at a weighing table rotation number of 370 rpm for 40 hours, and an amorphized sulfide solid electrolyte material (sample 1) was obtained."

So the key steps of the first example are:
1) Mixing Li2S and P2S5 powders in a glove box under Ar atmosphere to get a raw material composition.
2) Introducing the raw material composition into a zirconia pot with zirconia balls, sealing it with Ar atmosphere.
3) Using a planetary ball mill machine to perform mechanical milling at 370 rpm for 40 hours to obtain an amorphized sulfide solid electrolyte material (sample 1).
