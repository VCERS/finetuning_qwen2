Example 1
Modified sulfur silver germanium ore type sulfide electrolyte Li6.3 P0.75 Sn0.2 In0.05 S5 The preparation steps of (TFSI) are as follows:
(1) Calculation determines a=6.3, li is weighed in a glove box filled with argon according to a suitable molar ratio 2 S、P2S5、SnS2、In2S3 LiTFSI is sealed in a ball milling tank to avoid contact with air.
(2) The sealed ball milling tank is fixed on a planetary ball mill for ball milling at the rotating speed of 550rpm for 16 hours.
(3) Tabletting the initial solid electrolyte powder obtained in the step (2) under 370MPa in a glove box, wherein the thickness is 500 μm.
(4) And (3) placing the initial solid electrolyte sheet obtained in the step (3) in a quartz tube or a glass tube, and vacuum sealing.
(5) Placing the quartz tube or the glass tube sealed in the step (4) in a muffle furnace for sintering for 12 hours at 600℃ and at a temperature rise and fall rate of 0.5℃ for min-1.
(6) The solid electrolyte material obtained in the step (5) and LiNi0.8 Mn0.1 Co0.1 O2 And mixing the conductive carbon black with a binder in a ratio of 20:75:1:4, and grinding the mixture uniformly to obtain the anode powder. And dissolving the anode powder in dimethyl ether, magnetically stirring uniformly, and coating on an aluminum foil.
(7) And placing the powder of the sulfide solid electrolyte material in a tabletting mold, pressing into a solid electrolyte sheet, then placing the positive electrode sheet on one side of the solid electrolyte, pressing under pressure, attaching a lithium sheet on the other side of the solid electrolyte, and pressing into the all-solid-state battery.

This example demonstrates the preparation of a modified sulfur silver germanium ore type sulfide solid electrolyte with the formula Li6.3 P0.75 Sn0.2 In0.05 S5(TFSI). The preparation involves several steps including weighing the components in a glove box, ball milling, tabletting, vacuum sealing, sintering, mixing with anode material, and forming the all-solid-state battery.
