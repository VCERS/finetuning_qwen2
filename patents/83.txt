The original text of the first example is provided in Table 1 under the section "Working Examples (Nos. 1 to 10)" in the document. The details are as follows:

|No.| Composition | Pressing Method | Pressure during Pressing (MPa) | Thickness (mm) | Voidage (%) | Ion Conduction Value (S) | Discharge Capacity (Ah/cm3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1| Na2O: 14.9% | Isostatic | 40 | 0.18 | 6.9 | 4.4 | 1.11 |
|2| Na2O: 14.9% | Isostatic | 40 | 0.4 | 7.2 | 2.0 | 0.52 |
|3| Na2O: 14.2% | Isostatic | 40 | 0.18 | 5.8 | 5.4 | 1.60 |
|4| Na2O: 14.9% | Isostatic | 40 | 0.17 | 6.3 | 4.8 | 1.58 |
|5| Na2O: 14.2% | Isostatic | 40 | 0.18 | 5.2 | 6.5 | 1.67 |

This table outlines the composition, pressing method, pressure during pressing, thickness, voidage, ion conduction value, and discharge capacity for each of the first five examples (Nos. 1 to 5) in the document.
