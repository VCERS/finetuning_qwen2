The original text of the first example is:

Step 102 provides a metallorganic compound of metal (Me) and a material that may be carbon (C), sulfur (S), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), or combinations of the above-listed materials, expressed as MeXCYNZSXXOYY.

where Me is a metal, such as tin (Sn), antimony (Sb), lead (Pb), combinations of the above-listed metals, or a metal alloy. A metal alloy is defined as Sn, Sb, or Pb (or a combination of these metals) combined with another, unmentioned metal.

The variables listed above are defined as follows:

X is greater than 0; Y is greater than 0; Z is greater than or equal to 0; xx is greater than or equal to 0; and, YY is greater than or equal to 0;

In one aspect, Step 102 provides a plurality of metallorganic compounds with independent definitions of Me, X, Y, Z, XX, and YY.
