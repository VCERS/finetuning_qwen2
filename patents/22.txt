[Example 1]
As a starting material sulfide, lithium (Li2S, from Nippon Chemical Co., Ltd.) and, 5-sulfide 2 (P2S5, available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.) and sulfide, silicon (SiS2, producing highly pure Chemical Co.) and lithium chloride (LiCl, Ltd.) was used. These powders were mixed in a glove box under an argon atmosphere in the proportions shown in Table 1 below to obtain a raw material composition. Next, 1 g of the raw material composition was placed in a port made of zirconia (45 ml) together with zirconia balls (10 mmφ, 10 pieces), and the port was completely sealed (argon atmosphere). This port was attached to a planetary ball mill (preproduction P7) and subjected to mechanical milling for 40 hours at 370 rpm. Thereby, an amorphized ion conductive material was obtained.

Next, the obtained powder of the ion conductive material was placed in a carbon-coated quartz tube and vacuum-filled. The pressure of the vacuum enclosed quartz tube was about 30 Pa. Next, a quartz tube was set in a firing furnace, and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 550 °C for 6 hours, maintained at 550 °C for 8 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. Thereby, a sulfide solid electrolyte material having a composition of 0.11 (LiCl). (Li3.4 Si0.4 P0.6 S4) was obtained. The above composition corresponds to a composition of x = 0.6 and y = 10 in y (LiCl). (100-y) (Li(4-x)Si(1-x)PxS4).

This example demonstrates the production of a sulfide solid electrolyte material through a series of steps including mixing raw materials, mechanical milling to create an amorphous ion conductive material, and subsequent heating to achieve crystallinity. The resulting material has a specific composition and exhibits improved ion conductivity.
