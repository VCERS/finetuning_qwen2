**Example 1**

An all-solid-state battery using a positive electrode layer for all-solid-state batteries containing CuS (copper sulfide II) and elemental sulfur was prepared. The specific manufacturing method is as follows.

**[Synthesis of solid electrolyte]**
The solid electrolyte was manufactured by the following steps:
- LiI, Li2S, and P2S5 were weighed so that each had a molar ratio of 35LiI-65 (0.75Li2S-0.25P2S5), and mixed in a mortar.
- 1.5 g of the mixture was put into a 45 ml ZrO2 pot and mixed with a φ7 mm and φ5 mm ZrO2 ball in a planetary ball mill.
- The synthesis conditions were such that the product was rotated at 380 rpm for 10 min and repeated for 5 min, and the reaction was continued until the peak of each component in XRD (X-ray diffractometer) disappeared completely and became amorphous.
- All of the above operations were performed in an Ar atmosphere (H2O, O2<0.1 ppm) environment.
- The ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte thus obtained at room temperature was 1.2×10−3 S/cm.

**[Synthesis of positive electrode layer composition]**
The positive electrode layer composition was manufactured by the following steps:
- Mortar mixing was performed at a weight ratio of S:CuS:activated carbon=20:10:20, and 500 mg of the mixture was put into a 45 ml ZrO2 pot and mixed with a planetary ball mill together with φ7 mm and φ5 mm ZrO2 balls.
- The synthesis conditions were 360 rpm, 45 minutes rotation, and 15 minutes break, which was repeated 17 times.
- The recovered mixture and the same amount of the solid electrolyte were mixed in a mortar.
- About 1 g of this mixture was put into a 45 ml ZrO2 pot and mixed with a planetary ball mill together with φ7 mm and φ5 mm ZrO2 balls.
- The synthesis conditions were 360 rpm, 45 minutes rotation, and 15 minutes break, which was repeated 17 times.
- The weight ratio of each component in the obtained positive electrode layer composition is as follows (S:CuS:activated carbon:solid electrolyte = 20:10:20:50).

**[Fabrication of all-solid-state battery]**
Li metal foil for the negative electrode, the above-mentioned electrolyte for the electrolyte layer, and the positive electrode layer composition synthesized by the above method for the positive electrode were laminated in a Teflon cylinder (Teflon is a registered trademark) with a diameter of 13 mm, and the pressure was 4 ton/cm2. A solid battery was obtained by pressing. Further, the positive electrode layer composition was weighed and laminated so that the weight of the positive electrode active material (S+CuS) per unit area was 1 mg/cm2 and 5 mg/cm2.
