The original text of the first example is:

(Example 1) First, the reagents Li 2 S, Na 2 S, P 2 S 5, and Li Cl are weighed so as to have the target composition (Li 5.635 Na 0.115 ) PS 4.75 Cl 1.25, respectively, and then planetary type. Mechanical milling treatment was performed by mixing with a ball for 20 hours. The mechanical milling treatment was carried out at a rotation speed of 380 rpm, at room temperature, and in an argon atmosphere for 20 hours.

By pressing 300 mg of a powder material having a PS 4.75 Cl 1.25 composition (cation ratio 0.02) obtained by the above mechanical milling treatment (Li 5.635 Na 0.115 ) (pressure 400 MPa / cm 2 ). Pellets having a diameter of 13 mm and a thickness of about 0.8 mm were obtained. The obtained pellets were covered with gold leaf and further placed in a carbon crucible, and the carbon crucible was vacuum-sealed using a quartz glass tube. The vacuum-sealed pellets are heated from room temperature to 550 ° C. at 1.0 ° C./min using an electric furnace, heat-treated at 550 ° C. for 6 hours, and then cooled to room temperature at 1.0 ° C./min. By doing so, a sample (solid electrolyte) of Example 1 was obtained.

After pulverizing this sample using an agate mortar, X-ray crystal diffraction using CuKα rays was performed, and it was confirmed that the target Argyrodite crystal was produced (Fig. 2). In FIG. 2, A has a peak of 2θ = 15.42 ° ± 0.50 °, B has a peak of 2θ = 17.87 ° ± 0.50 °, and C has a peak of 2θ = 25.48 ° ± 0.50 °., D is a peak of 2θ = 30.01 ° ± 0.50 °, and E is a peak of 2θ = 31.38 ° ± 0.50 °.

In addition, baseline removal was performed using the X-ray diffraction pattern measured by this method, and the peak intensity of peak D: 2θ = 30.01 ° ± 0.50 ° was defined as IA, and peak F: 2θ = 33.65 ° ±. The value of IB / IA when the peak intensity of 0.50 ° was IB was 0.013.

The ionic conductivity of the obtained sample was measured by the following method. The sample crushed by the agate mortar was pressed (pressure 400 MPa / cm 2 ) to prepare pellets. In foil (thickness 50 μm) was attached to both sides of the pellet to obtain pellets for ionic conductivity measurement. The ionic conductivity obtained by this method at room temperature was 4.5 × 10 -3 S / cm.
