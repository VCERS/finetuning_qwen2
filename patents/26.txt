Example 1
A sulfide solid electrolyte, the component of which is 4.95Li2S-0.05Li2O2-GeS2-P2S5(i.e. Li)2O2Incorporation of Li10GeP2S12By substitution of part of Li2S), the preparation method comprises the following steps:
19.3145g of Li2S, 0.1948g of Li2O211.6148g of GeS218.8759g of P2S5The raw materials are mixed and placed in a 500mL roller mill pot, 400g of 10mm yttrium-stabilized zirconia grinding beads are added, and the mixture is ground at 150rpm for 24h until the mixture is uniformly mixed, so that a precursor is obtained. 2g of the precursor is pressed into a sheet, ten sheets are placed in a quartz tube with the inner diameter of 25mm and the length of 300mm, the quartz tube is sealed and calcined at 680 â„ƒ for 20min, and the calcined block is ground into powder to obtain sulfide solid electrolyte powder.
