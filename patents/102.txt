Example 1
(1) The chemical formula of Li is prepared by adopting a solid-phase reaction method 6.75 La 3 Zr 1.75 Ta 0.25 O 12 The preparation method of the lithium lanthanum zirconium oxygen-based solid electrolyte powder comprises the following steps: according to a molar ratio of Li, la, zr and Ta of 6.75 2 O 3 、ZrO 2 And Ta 2 O 5 Is prepared from LiOH 5wt% in alcohol through ball grinding for 24 hrDrying after time; then calcining for 10 hours at 900 ℃, heating up at the rate of 4 ℃/min, crushing and sieving the powder after sintering is finished to obtain Li 6.75 La 3 Zr 1.75 Ta 0.25 O 12 Powder (LLZTO).

(2) Mechanical ball milling: cladding material Li 3 PO 4 Placing the precursor and the mixed material of the LLZTO powder obtained in the step (1) into a grinding tank, adding ethanol, and grinding the mixed material by using a grinding ball; after grinding, heating the mixed material to evaporate ethanol, crushing, and separating the ball material by using a screening instrument to obtain mixed powder; the grinding balls are made of zirconium oxide, the ball-to-material ratio is 6:1, the ball-milling temperature is lower than 100 ℃, the ball-milling rotating speed is 800 r/min, and the ball-milling time is 10 hours.

(3) High-temperature calcination: calcining the mixed powder obtained in the step (2) in a high-temperature sintering furnace, and crushing and sieving the calcined powder to obtain Li 3 PO 4 Lithium lanthanum zirconium oxygen based solid electrolyte material (Li) coated with modified lithium lanthanum zirconium oxygen based solid electrolyte material capable of inhibiting lithium dendrite 3 PO 4 @ LLZTO); the calcining temperature is 1000 ℃, the calcining time is 10 hours, and the calcining atmosphere is air. Li 3 PO 4 @ LLZTO powder coating layer material Li 3 PO 4 The content of (B) is 1wt%.

The text describes the preparation of a lithium lanthanum zirconium oxygen-based solid electrolyte material capable of inhibiting lithium dendrites, specifically focusing on the first example. It outlines the steps involved in preparing the material, including the synthesis of the lithium lanthanum zirconium oxygen-based solid electrolyte (LLZTO), the mechanical ball milling process, and the high-temperature calcination step. The example also discusses the use of lithium phosphate (Li3PO4) as a coating material to enhance the material's ability to inhibit lithium dendrites.
