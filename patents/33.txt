The original text of the first example is as follows:

<Example 1>
Lithium sulfide (Li 2 S) powder 2.15 g, phosphorus sulfide (P 2 S 5 ) powder 1.84 g, and silicon sulfide (SiS 2 ) powder 1.02 g so as to have the composition formula shown in Table 1. Each was weighed and mixed, and pulverized with a ball mill for 12 hours to prepare a mixed powder. The mixed powder is filled in a carbon container, and this is heated at a temperature rising / lowering rate of 300 ° C./h while flowing 1.0 L / min of hydrogen sulfide gas (H 2 S, purity 100%) in a tubular electric furnace. Baked at 600 ° C. for 4 hours. Thereafter, the sample was crushed in a mortar and sized with a sieve having an opening of 53 μm to obtain a powdery sample.  At this time, the above weighing, mixing, setting in the electric furnace, taking out from the electric furnace, crushing and sizing operations are all carried out in the glove box substituted with sufficiently dried Ar gas (dew point -60 ° C or higher).
