Example 1:
As a starting material, lithium sulfide (Li 2 S, manufactured by Nippon Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), lithium oxide (Li 2 O, manufactured by Kojundo Chemical Co., Ltd.), two phosphorus pentasulfide 2 S 5, Aldrich Co.) and silicon sulfide (SiS 2, gojyun FIG Kagaku Co., Ltd.) was used. These powders were mixed with 0.34083 g of Li 2 S, 0.06819 g of Li 2 O, 0.38049 g of P 2 S 5 and 0.21047 g of SiS 2 in a glove box under an argon atmosphere to obtain a raw material composition. Next, 1 g of the raw material composition was placed in a zirconia pot (45 ml) together with zirconia balls (10 mm?, 10 pieces), and the pot was completely closed (argon atmosphere). This port was attached to a planetary ball mill (Fritz P7) and subjected to mechanical milling for 40 hours at 370 rpm. As a result, an amorphous ion conductive material was obtained.

Next, the obtained powder of the ion conductive material was placed in a carbon coated quartz tube and vacuum-filled. The pressure of the vacuum-quartz tube was about 30Pa. Next, a quartz tube was set in the baking furnace, and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 550 °C over 6 hours, maintained at 550 °C for 8 hours, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. As a result, Li 3.4 Si 0.4 P 0.6 (S 0.9 O 0.1) of the crystalline having 4 to obtain the composition of the sulfide solid electrolyte material. Further, the composition, Li (4-x) (M 2x) 1-δ Si δ) (1-x) P x (S 1 - y O y) 4 for x = 0.6, y = 0.1 in, and corresponds to the composition of? = 1.
