The original text of the first example is as follows:

Example 1 Lithium sulfide (purity 98.5%), diphosphorus pentasulfide (manufactured by Thermophos, purity 99.9% or more) and lithium chloride (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99%) produced in Production Example 1 are used as starting materials. (Hereinafter, in all the examples, the purity of each starting material is the same). The mol ratio (Li 2 S: P 2 S 5 : LiCl) of lithium sulfide (Li 2 S), diphosphorus pentasulfide (P 2 S 5 ), and lithium chloride (LiCl) is 46.8: 12.7: 40. Each raw material was mixed so as to be.5. Specifically, 0.483 g of lithium sulfide, 0.632 g of diphosphorus pentasulfide, and 0.385 g of lithium chloride were mixed to prepare a raw material mixture.

The raw material mixture and 30 g of zirconia balls having a diameter of 10 mm were placed in a planetary ball mill (Fritsch: model number P-7) in a zirconia pot (45 mL) and completely sealed. The inside of the pot had an argon atmosphere. A glass-like powder (intermediate) was obtained by processing (mechanical milling) for 15 hours at a rotation speed of 370 rpm with a planetary ball mill. The XRD pattern of the intermediate of Example 1 is shown in Figure 1. By processing with a planetary ball mill, a halo pattern indicating that the raw material has been vitrified can be confirmed. Most of the raw material remained, but most of it was glass. Approximately 1.5 g of the above intermediate powder is packed in a Tanman tube (PT2, manufactured by Tokyo Glass Equipment Co., Ltd.) in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere, the mouth of the Tanman tube is closed with quartz wool, and a SUS seal is used. The container was sealed to prevent air from entering. Then, the closed container was placed in an electric furnace (FUW243PA, manufactured by Advantech) and heat-treated. Specifically, the temperature was raised from room temperature to 500 ° C. at 2.5 ° C./min (the temperature was raised to 500 ° C. in 3 hours), and the temperature was maintained at 500 ° C. for 8 hours. Then, it was slowly cooled to obtain a sulfide solid electrolyte. Table 1 shows the raw material composition, production conditions, and evaluation results. The sulfide solid electrolyte was ICP-analyzed and the molar ratio of each element was measured. The results are shown in Table 2.

The ionic conductivity (σ) of the obtained sulfide solid electrolyte was 7.4 mS / cm. The electron conductivity was less than 10-6 S / cm. The XRD pattern of the obtained sulfide solid electrolyte is shown in Figure 2. Peaks derived from the algyrodite type crystal structure were observed at 2θ = 15.6, 18.0, 25.6, 30.1, 31.5, 45.2, 48, 1 deg. In addition, peaks derived from the novel crystal structure were observed at 2θ = 14.4, 29.2, and 33.8 deg. On the other hand, no diffraction peak derived from the Li 3 PS 4 crystal structure was observed. 

The solid 31 P-NMR measurement result of the obtained sulfide solid electrolyte is shown in Figure 3. A peak derived from the algyrodite structure was observed around 81 ppm, and a peak derived from the novel crystal structure was observed around 108 ppm. Moreover, as a result of peak separation of the peak derived from the algyrodite structure, no peak derived from the Li 3 PS 4 structure was observed. The Raman measurement result of the obtained sulfide solid electrolyte is shown in Figure 4. A peak 430cm around -1 was derived from Arujirodaito structure, a peak derived from a novel crystalline structure was observed in the vicinity of 390cm -1.
