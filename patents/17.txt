(Example 1)

(Synthesis of ion conductive material)

Lithium sulfide (Li 2 S), sodium sulfite (P 2 S 5 ), and germanium sulfide (GeS 2 ) were used as starting materials. These powders were mixed with 0.7769 g of Li 2 S, 0.8673 g of P 2 S 5 and 0.3558 g of GeS 2 in a glove box under an argon atmosphere to obtain a raw material composition. Next, the raw material composition was molded into pellets, and the obtained pellets were placed in a carbon-coated quartz tube and vacuum-filled. The pressure of the vacuum enclosed quartz tube was about 30 Pa. Next, a quartz tube was set in a baking furnace, and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 700 째C over 6 hours, maintained at 700 째C for 8 hours, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Thus, a crystalline ion conductive material having a composition of Li 3.25 Ge 0.25 P 0.75 S 4 was obtained. Further, the above composition corresponds to a composition of x = 0.75 in Li (4-x) Ge (1-x) P x S 4.

(Synthesis of Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Material)

Next, the obtained ion conductive material was pulverized using a vibrating mill. As the vibration mill, TI-100 manufactured by CMI Corporation was used. Specifically, about 2 g of the ion conductive material obtained by the above method and an alumina vibrator (36.3 mm in diameter, 48.9 mm in height) were put into a 10-mL port and treated at a rotation number of 1440 rpm for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the ion conductive material with reduced crystallinity was molded into pellets, and the obtained pellets were placed in a carbon coated quartz tube and vacuum-filled. The pressure of the vacuum enclosed quartz tube was about 30 Pa. Next, a quartz tube was set in the baking furnace, and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 550 째C over 6 hours, maintained at 550 째C for 8 hours, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Thus, a crystalline sulphide solid electrolyte material having a composition of Li 3.25 Ge 0.25 P 0.75 S 4 was obtained.

In summary, the first example describes the synthesis of a sulfide solid electrolyte material with a specific composition (Li 3.25 Ge 0.25 P 0.75 S 4) through two main steps: 
1) Synthesizing a crystalline ion conductive material from a raw material composition containing lithium sulfide, sodium sulfite, and germanium sulfide.
2) Lowering the crystallinity of the ion conductive material using a vibrating mill, then heating it to improve crystallinity and obtain the final sulfide solid electrolyte material.
