The original text of the first example for producing the positive electrode active material for a sodium ion battery is as follows:

(Positive electrode active material for sodium ion secondary battery) The positive electrode active material for a sodium ion secondary battery of the present invention is Na 2O 8 to 55%, NiO 10 to 70%, CrO + FeO + MnO + CoO 0 to 60%, P 2 O 5 + SiO 2 + B 2 O 3 in mol% in terms of oxide. It is characterized by containing 15 to 70% of O 3 and an amorphous phase. The reason for limiting each component in this way will be described below. In the following description of the content of each component, "%" means "mol%" unless otherwise specified.

Na 2 O is a source of sodium ions that move between the positive electrode active material and the negative electrode active material during charging and discharging. The content of Na 2 O is 8 to 55%, preferably 15 to 45%, particularly preferably 25 to 35%. If the amount of Na 2 O is too small, the amount of sodium ions that contribute to occlusion and release is small, and the discharge capacity tends to decrease. On the other hand, if the amount of Na 2 O is too large, different kinds of crystals such as Na 3 PO 4 that do not contribute to charging / discharging tend to precipitate, so that the discharge capacity tends to decrease.

NiO acts as a driving force for occlusion and release of sodium ions by causing a redox reaction by changing the valence of Ni ions during charging and discharging. The content of NiO is 10 to 70%, preferably 15 to 60%, 20 to 55%, 23 to 50%, 25 to 40%, and particularly preferably 26 to 36%. If the amount of NiO is too small, the redox reaction associated with charging and discharging is less likely to occur, and the amount of sodium ions occluded and released is reduced, so that the discharge capacity tends to decrease. On the other hand, if the amount of NiO is too large, different kinds of crystals tend to precipitate and the discharge capacity tends to decrease.

Similar to NiO, CrO, FeO, MnO and CoO act as a driving force for the absorption and release of sodium ions by causing a redox reaction by changing the valences of these transition metal element ions during charging and discharging...
