The original text of the first example is as follows:

**Example 1**

The solid electrolyte of 0.85 (Li5.5SiS4.5Br0.5)·0.15 (PS2.5) [Y=0.15] was synthesized using starting materials Li2S (Nihon Chemical Industry), SiS2 (Alfa Aesar), LiBr (Kojundo Chemical Lab.) and P2S5(Aldrich). They were mixed at the weight ratio (listed in Table 1) and put into the zirconium pot (45 mL) with 10 zirconium balls (ϕ10 mm) under argon. The pot was closed and treated with planetary milling equipment (Fritsch, P7) at 370 rpm for 40 h to obtain the precursor. The precursor was sealed into the glass tube at the pressure of 30 Pa and then heated at 500° C. for 8 h.

Whereas the weight ratios of the starting materials for Examples 2 to 4 and Comparative Example 1 are specified in Table 1.
