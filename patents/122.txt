The original text of the first example is as follows:

(Example 1)
Lithium sulfide (Li2S), diphosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5) and diphosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) were used as the starting materials. These powdery materials were weighed out in a glove box under an argon atmosphere so as to have a mole ratio of 75Li2S:15P2S5:10P2O5. The weighed materials were mixed with an agate mortar to obtain a raw material composition.

Next, 1 g of the raw material composition was placed into a 45 ml zirconia pot. In addition, 500 zirconia balls (Φ 4 mm) were placed into the pot. The pot was completely hermetically closed and installed in a planetary ball mill to perform mechanical milling at a rotational frequency of 510 rpm for 20 hours, thereby obtaining a glass having an ortho composition.

Then, the glass was subjected to a heat treatment in the condition of 290°C and two hours under an argon atmosphere. Therefore, a sulfide solid electrolyte (crystallized glass) of Example 1 was obtained.
