The original text of the first example is as follows:

Example 1
Lithium sulfide (Li 2 S) powder 2.14 g, phosphorous sulfide (P 2 S 5 ) powder 2.07 g, and lithium chloride (LiCl) powder 0.79 g were used so that the composition formula shown in Table 1 was obtained. Weighed and pulverized and mixed in a ball mill for 15 hours to prepare a mixed powder. The mixed powder is filled in a carbon container, and this is heated at a temperature rising / lowering rate of 200 ° C./h while circulating 1.0 L / min of hydrogen sulfide gas (H 2 S, purity 100%) in a tubular electric furnace. Baked at 400 ° C. for 4 hours. Thereafter, the sample was crushed in a mortar and sized with a sieve having an opening of 53 μm to obtain a powdery sample. In this case, the weighing, mixing, set to the electric furnace, taken out from the electric furnace, pulverized and sieved operations were all carried out in a glovebox substituted with Ar gas which is sufficiently dry. As a result of analyzing the obtained powdery sample (compound) by X-ray diffraction (XRD), it has a cubic crystal structure in the space group F-43m, and is represented by a composition formula: Li 6 PS 5 Cl. It was confirmed that this was a compound.
