The original text of the first example is as follows:

(preparation of Positive electrode mixture)
Preparing elemental sulfur (positive electrode active material, high purity chemical product), P2S5 (sulfide) and VGCF (conductive aid). These were weighed so as to be in the weight ratios shown in table 1, and the respective raw materials were mixed and stirred for 15 minutes in an agate mortar to obtain a raw material mixture. The obtained raw material mixture was charged into a container (45cc, ZrO) of a planetary ball mill 2 Preparation), then adding ZrO The ball (4 m, 96g) completely sealed the container. The vessel was mounted on a planetary ball mill (P7, manufactured by Fritsch), and mechanical polishing was repeated for a total of 48 hours by repeating a cycle of mechanical polishing for 1 hour (chassis rotation speed 510rpm), stopping for 15 minutes, reverse mechanical polishing for 1 hour (chassis rotation speed 510rpm), and stopping for 15 minutes. Thus, a positive electrode mixture was obtained.

This example describes the preparation of a positive electrode mixture for an all-solid-state battery. Elemental sulfur, P2S5, and VGCF are weighed in specific proportions, mixed, and then mechanically polished using a planetary ball mill to achieve a desired level of amorphosity. The resulting mixture is the positive electrode mixture used in the all-solid-state battery.
