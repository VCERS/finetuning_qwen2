Production Example 1  
(Production of lithium sulfide (Li2S))  
Under a nitrogen stream, 303.8 kg of toluene as a nonpolar solvent was added to a 500 L tank reactor, 33.8 kg of lithium hydroxide (an anhydrous product manufactured by Honjo Chemical Co., Ltd.) was added, and the mixture was stirred with a flat paddle type stirring blade at 131 rpm. The temperature was raised to 108 °C. while blowing hydrogen sulfide into the slurry at a supply rate of 10 L/hour. An azeotropic gas of water and toluene was continuously discharged from the 500 L tank reactor. This azeotropic gas was dehydrated by condensing with a condenser outside the system. During this time, the same amount of toluene as the distilled toluene was continuously supplied to keep the reaction liquid level constant. The amount of water in the condensate gradually decreased, and water distilling was not observed 24 hours after the introduction of hydrogen sulfide. During the reaction, the solid was dispersed and stirred in toluene, and there was almost no water separated from toluene. Subsequently, the temperature of the reactor was kept at 50 °C. while blowing hydrogen sulfide, and the reaction was carried out for 21 hours. Further, while the hydrogen sulfide was blown in, the temperature of the reactor was kept at 70 °C. and reacted for 10 hours. Thereafter, the temperature of the reactor was raised to 108 °C., the hydrogen sulfide was switched to nitrogen, and the mixture was circulated at 20 L/min for 16 hours to obtain a lithium sulfide toluene slurry. The obtained slurry was fed to a conical dryer, and after removing the supernatant toluene, it was vacuum dried at 90 °C. for 12 hours to obtain lithium sulfide.
