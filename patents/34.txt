The original text of the first example in the provided document describes the production of a lithium secondary battery additive represented by the formula Li₃Y₁-dInₐCl₆ (glass-ceramic phase) with d ranging from 0 to 1. Specifically, the example outlines the following steps for its production:

1. **Raw Materials**: 30 mmol of LiCl (1.29 g), 10-10a mmol of InCl₃, and 10a mmol of YCl₃ are used.

2. **Mixing**: These raw materials are ground together, placed in a zirconia ball mill jar, and then sealed and ground in a ball mill for 30 hours. The ball-to-powder weight ratio is 30:1, and the ball mill rotates at 550 rpm.

3. **Production**: After ball milling, the sample obtained is the Li₃Y₁-dInₐCl₆ additive in the glass-ceramic phase, where d can be 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, or 1.0.

The document also includes figures showing the X-ray diffraction pattern and ionic conductivity at different temperatures for the glass-ceramic phase Li₃Y₁-dInₐCl₆ (d=0.2) produced in this example. Additionally, there is a figure displaying the relationship between the value of d and the corresponding ionic conductivity of the product.
