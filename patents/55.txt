**Example 1**

A planetary ball mill (trade name: Classic Line P-7, manufactured by Fritsch) was installed. 0.661 g of lithium sulfide, 0.914 g of diphosphorus pentasulfide, 0.164 g of lithium bromide, and 0.261 g of iodine are weighed and put into a container for a planetary ball mill (45 cc, manufactured by Zirconia), and further dehydrated chlorobenzene (Moisture content: 10 ppm or less) 4 g was charged, and the container was completely sealed. This vessel was attached to the above planetary ball mill and mixed, stirred, and pulverized simultaneously at a base plate rotation speed of 500 rpm for 40 hours to produce a sulfide-based solid electrolyte.

20 ml of dehydrated chlorobenzene was added to the resulting slurry-like product containing the sulfide-based solid electrolyte and the solvent and recovered in a 50 ml Schlenk bottle. After the powder precipitated, the supernatant solvent was removed. Then, drying under reduced pressure using a vacuum pump while heating to 100 °C. in an oil bath, powdered sulfide-based solid electrolyte (80 (0.75Li2S / 0.25P2S5) / 10LiBr / 10LiI, Li: S: P: Br: I (molar ratio) = 1.400: 1.600: 0.400: 0.100: 0.100) was obtained.

When the obtained powdered amorphous sulfide-based solid electrolyte was subjected to powder X-ray analysis (XRD) measurement using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) apparatus (SmartLab apparatus, manufactured by Rigaku Corporation), a peak derived from the raw material was obtained. It was found that there was no other peak. Further, when the composition was analyzed by an ICP emission spectroscopic analyzer, Li: S: P: Br: I (molar ratio) = 1.390: 1.590: 0.400: 0.109: 0.101.

The obtained powdery amorphous sulfide-based solid electrolyte was heated at 188 °C. for 3 hours using a hot plate installed in a glove box to obtain a crystalline sulfide-based solid electrolyte. When the obtained sulfide-based solid electrolyte was subjected to powder X-ray analysis (XRD) measurement, crystallization peaks were detected at 2θ = 19.9 ° and 23.6 °. When the ionic conductivity of the obtained crystalline sulfide-based solid electrolyte was measured, it was 5.74 × 10 −3 (S / cm), and it was confirmed to have high ionic conductivity.
