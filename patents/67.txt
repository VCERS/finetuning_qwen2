Inventive Example 1
Hereinafter, a method for synthesizing and evaluating the solid electrolyte in the present example will be described.
[Production of Solid Electrolyte Material]
In a glove box maintained in a dry and low-oxygen atmosphere with a dew point of −90° C. or less and an oxygen value of 5 ppm or less, raw material powders LiBr, YBr3, LiI, and YI3 were prepared so as to have a molar ratio of Li:Y:Br:I=3:1:6−x:x. These were ground and mixed in a mortar. Subsequently, milling processing was performed at 600 rpm for 25 hours using a planetary ball mill.
In the inventive examples 1-1 to 1-7, the values of x were 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 5.5, respectively.
As a result, Li3YBr6-xIx powders, which were the solid electrolyte materials of the inventive example 1, were provided.

This describes the synthesis of the solid electrolyte material Li3YBr6-xIx through a series of steps involving preparation of raw material powders, grinding, mixing, and milling. The value of x varies across different examples to produce materials with different compositions.
