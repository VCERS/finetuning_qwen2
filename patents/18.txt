Example 1:
So that lithium sulfide (Li)2S), phosphorus pentasulfide (P)2S5) Lithium bromide (LiBr), lithium iodide (LiI), manganese (II) sulfide (MnS) (Li)2S∶P2S5LiBr: LiI: MnS) was added to a mixture of 55.81: 18.75: 15.00: 10.00: 0.44(Li/P was 3.64, M/P was 0.012, and S/P was 4.00 (calculated based on the amount used)), specifically, 0.5450g of lithium sulfide, 0.8857g of phosphorus pentasulfide, 0.2768g of lithium bromide, 0.2844g of lithium iodide, 0.0081g of manganese sulfide, 4.0g of dehydrated toluene (water content 10ppm or less), and 53g of zirconia balls (diameter: 5mm) was charged into a zirconia pot (capacity: 45mL) and sealed under an argon atmosphere. The zirconia pot was mounted on the planetary ball mill, and mixing and stirring were simultaneously performed at a turn table speed of 500rpm for 40 hoursAnd stirring and crushing the mixture to obtain a product of the amorphous sulfide solid electrolyte containing the metal element and the solvent.

In a glove box under an argon atmosphere, 10mL of dehydrated toluene was added to the product, which was recovered in a metal barrel, and after precipitation of powder (solid electrolyte), the solvent as a supernatant was removed. Then, the precipitated powder was dried on a hot plate at 80 ℃ to obtain a powdery amorphous sulfide solid electrolyte containing a metal element.

The obtained amorphous sulfide solid electrolyte containing a metal element was measured by powder X-ray analysis (XRD) using an X-ray diffraction apparatus (SmartLab apparatus, manufactured by japan), and no peak other than a peak derived from the raw material was found. Further, the obtained amorphous metal element-containing sulfide solid electrolyte was subjected to ICP emission analysis to calculate the molar ratio of each element (the molar ratio of lithium element to phosphorus element (Li/P), the molar ratio of metal element to phosphorus element (M/P), and the molar ratio of sulfur element to phosphorus element (S/P)), and subjected to a hydrolysis test. The results are shown in table 1.
