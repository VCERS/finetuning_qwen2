1. Material manufacturing process a) The following precursor (1) Li2S (Sigma Aldrich, 99.98%) (2) Boron (Sigma Aldrich 99%) and Sulfur, both in elemental form (3) SiO2  (4) LiI prepared.

step b) The mixture of precursors provided in step a) is prepared by combining the precursors in amounts such that the molar ratio of the elements Li, S, B, M, O and X in the resulting mixture conforms to general formula (I). It was produced by grinding to

For comparison, a mixture was produced without the addition of SiO2.

each mixture was pelleted.

All handling of powders was performed inside an argon-filled glovebox.

step c) For each heat treatment, the pelletized mixture obtained in step b) was placed in a vitreous carbon crucible, which was placed in a quartz tube. Each quartz tube was sealed under vacuum and placed vertically in a furnace. The quartz tube was heated to 500° C., held for 12 hours, and then held at 800° C. for 20 hours.

step d) After completing the heat treatment, the resulting melt was quenched in ice water.

The material obtained was in powder form. See the table below for details of the composition of the resulting material.
