To become Li5.4PS4.4Cl0.8Br0.8Manner of weighing Li2S powder, P2S5Powders, LiCl powders and LiBr powders so as to reach 75g in total. These powders were pulverized and mixed by a ball mill to obtain a mixed powder. The mixed powder was calcined to obtain a calcined product having the above composition. Firing was performed using a tubular electric furnace. During the firing, a hydrogen sulfide gas having a purity of 100% was passed through the electric furnace at a rate of 1.0L/min. The firing temperature was set to 500 ℃ and firing was carried out for 4 hours. The fired material was crushed using a mortar and pestle, and then pulverized using a wet-type bead mill to obtain a sulfide electrolyte raw material. The XRD measurement results confirmed that the sulfide electrolyte raw material had a crystalline phase of a sigermorite-type structure.

Mixing the obtained sulfide electrolyte raw material with LiBr. H2O was mixed under an Ar atmosphere to obtain a mixture. Relative to the sulfide electrolyte raw material and LiBr. H2The total amount of O is LiBr. H2The amount of O added was 10% by mass. The resultant mixture was heated at 120 ℃ for 1 hour under vacuum at-0.1 MPa, which is a gauge pressure when the atmospheric pressure was set to 0 Pa. Thus, the objective solid electrolyte was obtained.
